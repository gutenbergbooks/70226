</div>


<div class="dropcap">I</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">I</span>T is the author's hope that the following text may be of service
to apprentices to the trade, to vocational and trade school
students, and to manual training students. The author's
experience as a carpenter leads him to feel that not a few journeyman
carpenters may find their horizon widened and their usefulness
as framers of the unusual roof increased by a study of Chapter IV
where an effort has been made to indicate how the principles involved
in framing the square and octagonal roof may be "generalized"
so as to make possible their application to roofs of any
number of sides. Beyond this, the book makes claims to being
nothing more than an elementary treatise of the essentials of
carpentry.</p>

<p>No apology is offered for making use of trigonometric solutions
of plane right triangles as a basis for developing generalized roof
framing principles in Chapter IV. There is absolutely nothing in
the use of natural trigonometric functions to prevent their introduction
early in the mathematical experience of a boy, except
academic tradition. The author has made use of this mathematical
tool with upper grammar grade boys with less effort upon
their part in mastering the principles than was expended in mastering
square root. The ease with which roof framing problems lend
themselves to solution by the use of natural trigonometric functions
and the readiness with which problems may be generalized thereby
has emboldened the author to make use of it in a text as elementary
as this. No previous knowledge of trigonometry is presupposed,
the Appendix provides all the information required for the solution
of any problem given herein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">-8-</span></p>

<p>Should a reader, because of lack of time or for any other cause,
not care to consider more than roof framing of the square cornered
building, he will find a complete treatise in Chapter III without
reference to solutions other than by common arithmetic. Appendix
IV offers a still more abbreviated approach to both square and
octagonal roof framing.</p>

<p>The greatest good in studying the chapter on "Estimating" will
come only when each student is provided with a set of plans and
specifications completely drawn, as by a practicing architect.
Plans and specifications, such as will serve the purpose, can be
purchased at small cost from architectural companies, should local
architects be unwilling to provide sets for the schools.</p>

<p>Also, there must be provided for each student, catalogs of
lumber and millwork specifications and prices. These can be
obtained from mail order lumber and millwork companies. As a
rule, local lumber and millwork companies are glad to provide such
data, but it must be in a form complete, and readily accessible to be
of the greatest value.</p>

<p><b>1. Laying out Foundations.</b>—In most communities it is
customary for the carpenter to be present and to assist the mason
in the laying out of the foundations. Where buildings are large
and important, this work is
done by an engineer with a
steel tape and a surveyor's instrument,
<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1.</a> This instrument
is known as a builder's
transit, and consists of a tripod
upon which rests a small telescope
with crossed hair wires
within, by means of which the
observer may fix the line of
sight very accurately. A circular
dial contains a magnetic
needle which enables the fixed
dial to be set with reference to
the true north and south line
of the observer. After the fixed
dial has been adjusted, the telescope
may be swung to the right
or the left until the circular
graduations indicate that it
points in the direction wanted,
after which stakes may be set.
A level upon the telescope enables the observer to sight grades
or levels; a helper carrying the leveling rod, <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">-14-</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 2 Leveling Rod</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a> shows a more common instrument. This is an architect's
Y-level and differs from the other in that it is less complete.
It has no attachment for measuring vertical
angles. This is not serious, however, since the builder
seldom needs such an attachment,
the level being the most
essential part. Y-levels are made
both with and without compass
attachments.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp86" id="fig_3" style="max-width: 11.125em;">
  <img src="images/fig_3.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 3 Y-Level</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Upon ordinary residence work
a surveyor is employed to locate
lot lines. Once these lines are
located the builder is able to locate the building lines by
measurement. Suppose it is desired to locate a building
by means of the side lot line: (1) Measure from the side
lot line, along the front and along the back lot lines, a
distance equal to that which it is desired the house shall
hold relative to the lot side line. Drive stakes here. (2)
While sighting from one of these stakes to the other,
have an assistant locate two other stakes in the line of
sight, a distance apart sufficient to guarantee the placing
of the cross-lines for the back and front of the house
without restaking these, <i>A-B</i>, <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4.</a> The process of
laying out lines for a house is almost identical with that
used in laying out a rectangle on a drawing board.
(3) Having located a line of indefinite length for one side
of the house, a second line of indefinite length, preferably
for the front of the building, may next be located. To do
this, first locate a front corner stake upon the first line
just located. This is done by measurement from the
street line. Having located and driven in this stake, <i>A</i> , <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, drive
a nail in the top of the stake to more accurately locate this corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">-15-</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_4" style="max-width: 32.5em;">
  <img src="images/fig_4.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 4. Batter Boards</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If an instrument is available it will be located over this stake and
the front line <i>A-C</i>, <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, located by laying it off at 90 degrees
from the side line already located. If no instrument is available,
the front line may be laid off at right angles to <i>A-B</i> by holding a
framing square at their intersection. This angle should be verified
by the 6-8-10 method. This consists in measuring from the
intersection at <i>A</i> along one line a distance of 6 feet and sticking a
pin in the line at that point; a pencil mark may be used when the
cord is white. In a similar manner, measure off 8 feet along the
other line and then measure the hypotenuse of the triangle so
formed. It should measure 10 feet. If it does not, the front
building line must be shifted until it does. (4) With these two
lines located, the remaining two lines may be located by measurement
from them, the nail of stake <i>A</i> giving the starting point.
Before this is attempted, however, the batter boards should be
placed. Batter boards are variously constructed. Those shown
are common types. They should be placed free of the foundation
proposed by at least 3 or 4 feet. (5) Test the squareness of the
whole lay-out by measuring the diagonals <i>A-D</i> and <i>B-C</i>. If the
building lay-out is square the diagonals should be equal. If they
are not equal, shift the cords at <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, retaining their parallelism,
until the diagonals become equal. (6) Once the lay-out is correct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">-16-</span>
saw kerfs should be made in the batter boards where the cords are
placed. These kerfs will permit the cords being removed and replaced
without further measuring.</p>

<p><b>2. Grade Line.</b>—A properly drawn set of plans will show
both the present lay of the ground upon which the building is to
be erected and the new grade line which is to be established after
the building is completed. The most convenient method of
determining old grade lines and of establishing new ones is by
means of the transit, <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>, or the Y-level, Figs. <a href="#fig_3">3</a> and <a href="#fig_5">5</a>, with the
rod, <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2.</a> Both instruments operate upon the same principle in
grade work. The telescope is set level and sights taken thru it
to the target upon the rod. The reading of the target's position
upon the rod compared with the height of the telescope above the
base, usually the street walk, determines the difference in grade
of that particular placing of the target.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_5" style="max-width: 30.5625em;">
  <img src="images/fig_5.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 5. Taking Sights with Y-Level</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To locate levels for the masonry, (1) set the instrument at some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">-17-</span>
convenient place and level the dial. (2) Having determined the
height of the instrument above some predetermined base, such as
the street walk, swing the telescope about and, making allowance
for the difference in level as shown by the drawings, place successively
stakes at each corner of the building with the required
level marked thereon. As a rule, the mason has his own Y-level
and uses it freely as the wall is constructed, especially where levels
are to be maintained as the layers of material are placed.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_6" style="max-width: 30.6875em;">
  <img src="images/fig_6.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 6. Leveling with Straight-edge</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In a similar manner the earth grade about the building may be
located, stakes being driven into the ground at frequent intervals
and the amount of "fill" or reduction indicated thereon. Grade
levels are established usually only after the builders are thru,
except that the mason will have the grade indicated for him where
the wall above the grade is to be differently finished from that
below.</p>

<p>Where no surveyor's level is at hand, the mason or carpenter
will secure the levels by means of a straight-edge of some 14 feet
in length. A common level is placed upon this plank as shown in
<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6.</a> By successive levels with stakes driven to indicate the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">-18-</span>
successive levelings, a grade may be carried quite a distance without
very great variations.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp68" id="fig_7" style="max-width: 16.625em;">
  <img src="images/fig_7.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 7. Foundation Detail</figcaption>
</figure>


<p><b>3. Excavations.</b>—Excavations should be made enough larger
than the proposed foundation that the mason may have room to
wield his trowel in pointing the
outer joints, and for waterproofing.
An extra foot of excavation
upon each side will
usually be required.</p>

<p>All foundations must be
carried well below the frost
line. Excavations should be
made accordingly.</p>

<p><b>4. Foundations; Footings.</b>—Because of the tendency of
a building to settle unevenly,
due to variations in the
strength of the supporting
ground or the unequal weight placed upon this ground, foundations
must be constructed of some non-yielding material such
as brick or stone, and of such thickness and so bonded that the
weight of the building may be evenly distributed.</p>

<p>The thickness of wall will depend upon the weight to be supported
and upon the character of the soil.</p>

<p>Unless rock or gravel is encountered, every foundation should
have a footing, <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7.</a> The amount of footing used is usually
twice the thickness of the foundation wall. In brick walls this
footing draws into the wall by "stepped" courses of brick, each
layer being narrower than the one just preceding. For ordinary
residence work with ordinary soil conditions a 10- or 12-inch wall
resting upon a footing 2 feet wide and 8 or 10 inches deep will
suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">-19-</span></p>

<p>A safe footing for supporting posts of 66" × 6" yellow pine, for
most soils, will be 10 inches deep by 18 inches square. Partition
walls carrying no unusual load need not be over 8 inches in
thickness.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 9. English Bond</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In many communities the use of concrete is supplanting that
of stone or brick, especially below the grade line. Such a wall
should be composed of 5 parts of crushed stone or gravel, 3 parts
sand, and 1 part cement. The footing may be formed by tamping
the mixture in a form made by spading out of the earth a depth and
width sufficient for the wall to be supported.</p>

<p><b>5. Foundation Materials; Construction.</b>—Of the materials
commonly used in the construction of foundations monolithic
concrete is becoming the most common for that part of the wall
which lies below the ground or grade level. Brick and stone are
sometimes used.</p>

<p>Where brick or stone is made use of, some device is required to
"tie" the material together, due to the fact that the mortar used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">-20-</span>
in filling the voids or spaces between the members has little
strength as compared with that of the stone or brick itself. This
bonding is secured by placing the brick or stone so that they shall
overlap one another, both along the faces of the wall and across
the wall.</p>

<p>Bricks laid with their lengths in the same direction as that
of the wall are known as stretchers; those laid with their lengths
across the wall are known as headers, <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8.</a> The manner of
placing these headers among the stretchers determines the type
of bond. The American, English and Flemish are the more common
types. Of these the American, <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>, is the most used upon
ordinary work. It consists of a course of headers placed every
sixth course. The English bond, <a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>, is much stronger, having
every other course a header course. It is used mainly upon very
important work where unusual strength is required. Flemish
bond is illustrated in <a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10.</a></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_10" style="max-width: 27.625em;">
  <img src="images/fig_10.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 10. Flemish Bond</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of the various types of stone work, rubble work and ashlar
predominate, <a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11.</a> Rubble work is most frequently used for
that part of the wall below the grade line, and ashlar for the remainder
of the wall. In either case, thru stones are placed every
4 or 5 feet in the length of the wall and every 18 inches in the
height, to provide bonds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">-21-</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp53" id="fig_11" style="max-width: 31.375em;">
  <img src="images/fig_11.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 11. Types of Stone Work</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">-22-</span></p>

<p>In rubble work the stones are rough and unhewn. They must
be laid upon a good bed of stiff mortar with their stratifications
in a horizontal position. Otherwise, the face of the wall might
"peel" from the effects of frost and moisture, making an unsightly
as well as a weaker wall. The term "ashlar" refers to a wall
builded of stones having finished faces. When either rubble work
or ashlar is laid up in courses it is known as coursed rubble or
coursed ashlar. When the horizontal joints are not continuous
the wall is known as random rubble or broken ashlar.</p>

<p>Not infrequently a wall will be constructed with an ashlar
facing attached to a brick backing by means of metal bonds. In
such a wall, the faced ashlar, unless more than 8 inches in thickness
and well bonded into the wall, should not be considered in estimating
the strength of the wall.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp77" id="fig_12" style="max-width: 23.3125em;">
  <img src="images/fig_12.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 12. "Form" for Concrete</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the construction of both brick and stone walls the work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">-23-</span>
should be carried up as nearly as possible at the same levels. In
both brick and stone walls the corners are run up with stepped
courses, the corners being plumbed as the wall is carried upward.
A line is then stretched between the corners and, layer by layer, the
rest of the wall filled in. No corner should, ordinarily, be carried
more than 3 feet above the rest of the wall. In the case of uncoursed
stone work the wall is leveled every 15 to 18 inches in its
height.</p>

<p><b>6. Forms for Concrete Walls.</b>—The economical building of
forms for concrete walls is a matter of importance in building construction.
<a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a> shows a type of form suitable for foundation
work. Such forms should be made of semi-seasoned stock.
Thoroughly seasoned stock will warp badly when the wet concrete is
placed. Spruce, Norway pine, etc., are better woods to use than
hard or Georgia pine.</p>

<p>For ordinary foundation work 1-inch boards may be used, the
studs being placed not over 2 feet apart. These studs may be
assisted materially in holding the forms in position, by wires placed
as in <a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>, and by props placed against the dirt wall of the
excavation.</p>

<p>In placing the concrete a 4-inch layer is laid and then "spaded"
or "worked" well into place, a "wet mix" being used. The
smoothness of the resulting faces is increased by an additional
spading of the mixture away from the form. A good spading tool
is made by straightening out an ordinary garden hoe. This allows
the cement and mortar to flow next to the form and hold this place
while the filling proceeds.</p>

<p>Where forms are placed to give finished walls, that is, walls to
which no plaster is to be applied, they should be aligned with no
greater variation than ⅜" from the lines specified.</p>

<p>Forms should be allowed to remain until the concrete will
resist indentation with the thumb, upon ordinary walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">-24-</span></p>

<p>There is no limit to the ingenuity one may make use of in form
building. The illustration given is merely suggestive.</p>

<p><b>7. Waterproofing.</b>—The extent to which a wall should be
waterproofed will depend upon the location of the building.
Foundations near running water must naturally be better protected
than those in well drained locations. <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a> illustrates a treatment
which will prove quite safe for almost all localities. The exterior
face of the wall is covered with several layers of asphaltum or tar.
By coating the top of the footing and the top of the concrete floor
just before the finish floor of cement is placed, little water will
enter. A drain tile carried about the house as shown in <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>,
especially if gravel is placed against the wall above it, will meet
every emergency.</p>

<p>There are other ways of waterproofing basement walls, but this
is typical of the external wall treatments. In monolithic construction
waterproofing may be secured by appropriate additions to the
mixture of waterproofing materials such as slacked lime, just before
the mixture is placed, no external applications being required.</p>

<p><b>8. Basement Frames.</b>—<a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a> illustrates one successful form
of basement window frame construction, with sash. In this type
the sash is hinged to the top of the frame, and a catch or button
at the bottom of the frame secures the sash when closed. The
construction is such as to best shut out wind and water when the
sash is closed.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp69" id="fig_14" style="max-width: 21.625em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 14. Basement Door Frame</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a> illustrates a basement door frame. Frames such as
this, and the window frame of <a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a>, are made of heavy stock and
are known as plank frames.</p>

<p>Basement frames are held in place by means of wooden blocks
nailed to the sides of the frame, as well as by the projecting "lugs"
of the frame itself. The frame is set and plumbed by the carpenter
as soon as the mason has prepared the sill. <a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a> shows a
frame plumbed and stayed, ready for the mason to lay the adjacent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">-26-</span>
wall. <a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a> indicates the position of plumb and level in the setting
of a frame. The edges of a door frame are "sighted" for wind.</p>

<p>Where it is necessary to attach frames or other woodwork to
brick walls, it is customary to have the mason insert wooden
"bricks" as the wall is constructed. Wooden bricks are of the
same size as other bricks, and should be constructed with the edge
which is to be laid back in the wall thicker than the front edge, so
that a dovetailed effect is secured.</p>

<p><b>9. Methods of Framing the Superstructure.</b>—In the early
days when lumber was plentiful, houses and barns were framed
in what is known as "full
frame." Such frames consisted
of heavy and solid
timbers mortised and
tenoned and pinned together,
Figs. <a href="#fig_16">16</a> and <a href="#fig_17">17</a>.
With the growing scarcity
of lumber the "half
frame" of <a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a> became
common. This latter
type, it will be seen, makes
less use of heavy timbers
and wooden pins, and
more use of planks and
nails. To-day the vast
majority of buildings,
where wood is the material
used, are constructed
by what is known as
"balloon framing" in
houses and "plank framing"
in barns, Figs. <a href="#fig_19">19</a>
and <a href="#fig_20">20</a>. In view of this,
attention will be directed
to balloon framing only. One who is able to frame a house
should have no trouble with plank barn framing, where drawings
show the details.</p>

<p>It must be understood, too, that there are quite a variety of
ways of framing a balloon and a plank frame. It will be possible
in this chapter to treat of but one type. A mastery of this one
type should enable the student to work out other types, with
suitable detailed drawings provided him.</p>

<p><b>10. Sills and Girders.</b>—In <a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a> will be found illustrated
three types of box sill construction. Whatever the sill used, care
must be taken to so plan that mice may not have free access to the
various parts of the building. If the sill does not inhibit, then
blocks should be spiked between the studs. Such blocks serve as
fire breaks.</p>

whole thoroughly spiked together,
form the girder.
The advantage of this
type of girder lies mainly
in the fact that it leaves
the headroom of a basement
clear, which is not
the case in the type shown
in <a href="#fig_22b">Fig. 22-b</a>. This second
type is somewhat easier
to frame, and is therefore
greatly used where the
owner does not object.
It is better where furnace stacks must be placed in a partition
above it.</p>

<p>First floor joists, like second floor joists and studs, should be
spaced 16 inches from center to center, beginning at one side or
end of a room. Not to make such provision would cause a waste
in lathing, since the lath are
all 4 feet in length, a multiple
of 16 inches. Any remainder
after such a spacing should be

the carrying power of floor
joists, bridging is cut in between them as shown in <a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23.</a>
For ordinary dwellings
1" × 3" stock will serve. On
large work, stock two inches
thick should be made use of.
Bridging should be spaced not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">-33-</span>
more than 8 feet apart. A miter-box, set at the appropriate angle,
may be used in cutting bridging, all the pieces being cut at one time
with the exception of those for the odd spacings at the side or end
of a room. A more common practice is to take a piece of stock,
and, after cutting a bevel on one end, place it as in <a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a> with
the beveled end above the lower edge of the joist against which it
rests, a distance slightly in excess of the thickness of the stock;
then saw as indicated, sawing vertically and along the joist.</p>

<p>Before placing bridging, the joist must be spaced and properly
fastened in place. This is done by placing a piece of stock, 1" × 6"
or 2" × 4", as in <a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24.</a> With a try square, mark the locations
of the joists. This board may then be transferred to the center
of the room and the joists there spaced according to the marks, and
held in place by being "tacked." A second method consists in
placing the spacing board in the center of the room and having
a second person sight the joists for straightness while the first
party places them as directed
and tacks them. This tacking
consists in driving the nails
only partially in, leaving the
heads project enough that they
may later be withdrawn with a
claw hammer. Still another
method is to lay off the "stay"
by measurement with the framing
square so that it corresponds
with the spacings of the joists
at the side walls.</p>

<p>Bridging should be nailed
with two nails at each end of
the piece.</p>

<p>Corner posts are

placed. <a href="#fig_32a">Fig. 32-a</a>
shows a section of a
corner post which
has much to commend
it. <a href="#fig_32b">Fig. 32-b</a>
illustrates a more
common type of
construction. The
most serious objection
to this type is
the fact that the
post must be furred
after the lather has placed the lath upon one side of the room.
Corner posts are plumbed and stayed in two directions, after being
raised, <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33.</a> Either 2" × 4" or 1" × 6" stock will be used for
stays. With the corner posts set, the ribband boards are placed.
Where the span is too long for any available length of ribband
board, in laying out the ribband boards provision must be made for
their "breaking" joints upon studs. These studs will be raised
immediately after the corner posts, the ribband board attached to
corner post and stud, after which the stud will be plumbed and
stayed, <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34.</a> Studs are framed before being raised so that
ribband boards may be "let into" them as shown in <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34.</a> Second
and third floor joists will be notched to slip over these boards
and will be spiked to the studs in addition. Remaining studs are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">-40-</span>
placed one at a time, one man setting up and nailing the foot while
another fastens the ribband board to the stud at the second floor

<p>With the completion of the raising of the two outside walls
which are to bear the joist ends, the middle partition, should there
be one, paralleling these walls should be framed and raised. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">-41-</span>
slightly different procedure from that just described is followed,
that is, instead of raising one stud at a time the whole partition is
framed and nailed together upon the floor, even to the cutting
in of headers, etc. When a section such as the number of men
available can raise is ready, the same is raised, and stayed after
being plumbed. The studs of partitions
are framed but one story high
and "plated" at such a height that
second floor joists may be placed
thereon in splicing. Just as far as
possible first and second floor joists
should be spaced to rest one directly
above another and in line with the
supporting studs of partitions so that
furnace stacks may be placed with
ease. If joists rest upon partition
plates and not directly above studs,
a double plate must be made use of.</p>

<p>Having placed the second floor
joists, the studs at the ends of the
house may be set up. Their locations
will be marked upon sill and upon
second floor joist which is to be
placed at the end of the house. This
marking is best done by placing the
joist upon the sill and transcribing
the marks laid out upon the sill to the joist, after which it is to
be raised into place.</p>

<p>Double plates will next be framed. They should break upon
studs and be marked by transcribing the marks for the studs from
the sills. At the corners the plates will be framed with butt joints,
the second set lapping over the joints made by the first plate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">-42-</span></p>
<p>Next, the sustaining middle partition of the second story is

<p>All walls and partitions are now "lined up," that is, any irregularities
are taken out by additional stays.</p>

<p>False or rough floors are laid in the
various stories where not already placed,
bridging being placed and openings for
stairs and chimneys framed. Such floors
are laid either diagonally or straight
across the joists. The diagonal floor is
considered better, <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27.</a></p>

<p><b>14. Openings in Framework.</b>—Studs
in outside walls are set without reference
to openings for doors and windows. Such
openings are cut and headers and stools
placed after the walls are up and ready
for sheathing. The seeming waste occasioned
by this method is slight since
the cut-out material is available for
headings, etc. Most carpenters make
a story pole to be used in laying off
window and door heights in cutting out
studs. This is nothing more than a piece of 1" × 2" or 1" × 3"
stock with the heights of the openings from the rough floor or
from the joists, where the rough floor is not laid, marked plainly
thereon. This pole is placed alongside the stud to be cut and
the mark transcribed from pole to stud.</p>

<p>Beginners are frequently troubled in determining the proper
opening, even when the size of the window is specified. In general,
carpenters plan to have the studs on either side of an opening,
either door or window, so set that the outer edges of the exterior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">-43-</span>
casings will break upon their centers. Windows are specified by
the width and height of their glass and the number of divisions or
lights, width always being specified first. The distribution of
excess measurement due to the meeting rail, top and bottom rails,
side rails or stiles is shown in <a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36.</a> Rail and stile widths and
sash thicknesses will vary from those given when any very great
increase in size of window is made. Manufacturers of sash and
doors provide catalogs in which stock sizes are listed.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_37" style="max-width: 29.75em;">
  <img src="images/fig_37.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 37. Framing Wall Openings</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Estimate an opening vertically, <a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>, thus: Sill, 2"; subsill,
where frame is made with one, 1"; bottom rail, from edge to
bottom of rabbet, 3"; glass in lower sash, 34"; meeting rail, from
rabbet to rabbet, 1"; glass in upper sash, 34"; top rail, 2"; space
for head jamb and lugs of side jambs, 2" or 3"; total, 79". A
carpenter would say, "Add 11" to the glass measurement to get
vertical height between stool and header." Window sashes with
muntins require an addition of ¼" for each muntin. The thicknesses
of header and stool must be considered in addition to the
measurement just mentioned when studs are sawed, <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37.</a></p>

<p>The width between studs would be estimated thus: Width of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">-44-</span>
glass, 28"; width of stiles, from rabbeted edge to outer edge, 4";
width of casings, 8"; total 40", distance from center of stud to
center of stud. Comparing this with the width of glass it will be
seen that the difference is 12". A carpenter, therefore, makes use
of a general rule: Add 10" to the glass measurement to get distance
between studs, where a 4" or
4½" casing is used with this
type of window frame.</p>

</figure>

<p>For the 3' x 7' door, Figs.
<a href="#fig_37">37</a> and <a href="#fig_38">38</a>, estimate the opening
as follows: Height of door,
7'; allowance for rough floor,
¾"; finish floor, ¾"; threshold,
⅝" to ¾", head jamb
and space for lugs of side
jambs, 2" to 3"; total from
joist, may be 7' 5".</p>

<p>For the width of opening
estimate: Width of door, 3';
width of casings, at 4½" each,
9"; total spacing of studs center to center, 3' 9". Distance between
studs will be 3' 7". This will leave space enough to put
the doubling studs on each side between header and floor. Since
locations of openings in the main frame, both window and door,
are dimensioned to the centers of the openings, it is easiest in
laying off to estimate from the center each way rather than to
estimate total width.</p>

<p>After these openings are made, the frame of the house may be
covered with sheathing, or the roof may be framed; both orders of
procedure are common.</p>

are used. An effort will be made in this treatment to indicate the

    Fig. 39. Roof Types</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In <a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a> are illustrated four types of roof. Figs. <a href="#fig_40">40</a>, <a href="#fig_41">41</a>, and
<a href="#fig_42">42</a> illustrate the rafter forms and the names of the various cuts
to be made in framing the members to place. The common rafter,
it will be seen, has three cuts—plumb or ridge cut, seat or heel or
plate cut, and end cut. The hip, valley, and jack have four cuts
each; a side cut or cheek cut is possessed by each in addition to the
three cuts belonging to the common rafter.</p>

<p>Before any rafter can be framed, the rise and run of the common
rafter, in other words, the pitch of the roof, must be known.</p>

<p>In roof framing, the "run" of a rafter when in place is the
horizontal distance measured from the extreme end of the seat
to a point directly below the ridge end of the rafter, <a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43.</a> The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">-46-</span>
"rise" is the vertical distance from the ridge end of the rafter to
the level of the seat. The "pitch" of a roof or rafter is the ratio
of the rise of the rafter to the span or whole width of the building.</p>

</figure>

<p>The terms rise, run, and rafter length have still another set of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">-47-</span>
meanings—they may be used to designate "unit" lengths. In
all such cases 12" of run of the common rafter is assumed as the
base, and the other unit lengths or constants are computed from
this constant. The numerical values of these constants will be
computed as the development of the subject of roof framing makes
their use necessary.</p>

<p>It will be noted in <a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44</a> that the constant of run, or 12", is
taken along the tongue and the rise per foot of run along the blade
of the square. It is not essential that this order be followed; the
beginner will generally find it easier to visualize his work, however,
if he keeps the tongue for either rise or run, and the blade for the
opposite. There are occasions when the reverse order is necessary
no matter which form is followed, so that it is unwise to insist upon
only one way.</p>

<p>The variation in terminology in roof framing is so general that
the beginner will do well to familiarize himself with the most common.
Hereafter an effort will be made to confine the text to
the following: plumb cut, seat cut, end cut, side cut.</p>

<p>The value to a beginner of a carefully made plan of a roof to be
framed with necessary data such as rafter lengths and positions
indicated thereon, cannot be too strongly emphasized. Architects
not infrequently prepare elaborate and complete framing plans for
the use of the carpenter. Upon intricate plans, experienced men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">-49-</span>
prepare plans before attempting to frame the same. <a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>
illustrates a framing plan ready for the placing thereon of the

<p><b>16. Framing the Common Rafter; Laying out the Plumb Cut.</b>—While
in this discussion the plumb cut is first described, it should
be understood that it is equally as convenient and more common
among carpenters to begin the framing of the members of a square
cornered roof frame with the end and seat cuts. In framing other
than a square cornered roof it is somewhat more convenient to
begin with the plumb cut.</p>

<p>The method of framing of the common rafter is the same for
all buildings, whether the buildings have four sides or more or less.
(1) Place the framing square as in <a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45-b</a>, taking 12" on the tongue
as the run, and upon the blade the rise in inches per foot of run.
Keep these numbers against the crowning, or what is to become
the top edge of the rafter, and scribe along the blade. This gives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">-50-</span>
the plumb cut. Occasionally a carpenter will be found who frames
to a center line rather than the top edge of a rafter.</p>

relative to his work. Such a position will seem awkward to the
beginner but he should learn to visualize his work while in this
position that the efficiency of framing may not be reduced thru
the awkward position first likely to be assumed.</p>

<p id="sec_17"><b>17. To Find the Length
of a Common Rafter.</b>—<i>First
Method:</i> The theoretic length
of a rafter is indicated by
the center lines in Figs. <a href="#fig_45">45-a</a>
and <a href="#fig_48">48</a>. In estimating the
total length of stock for a
rafter having a tail, the run
of tail or length of lookout
must be considered.</p>

<p>The pitches most commonly
used are the half, third,
and quarter. From an examination of <a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a> it will be seen that
the length of a common rafter is the hypotenuse of a right triangle
whose legs are the rise and the run of the roof. The problem, then,
of finding the length of a common rafter when the rise and run
are known is merely that of solving the equation <i>c²</i> = <i>a²</i> + <i>b²</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">-51-</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_48" style="max-width: 26.1875em;">
  <img src="images/fig_48.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 48. Rafter Length</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Practical carpenters would not consider it economy to take
time to solve for rafter lengths in this manner, for every variation
in rise or run would necessitate a rather long solution. Instead,
they have discovered that for every foot of run of a rafter the
length of the rafter increases proportionately, the ratio of rise to
run remaining the same, <a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44.</a> With a table, therefore, in which
the length of rafter for each foot of run, for each of the common
pitches is given, the length of rafter for any given pitch can be
found by merely multiplying the constant given by the amount of
run for that particular rafter.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a> shows such a table worked out for a rather extended
number of pitches. From this table it will be seen that the number
to take as a constant for the run is 12", and that the rise in inches
per foot of run is taken upon the other member of the framing
square. A jack rafter as will be illustrated later is but a shortened
common rafter, therefore, what is said of the common rafter is also
true of the jack rafter. The jack, however, has an additional cut
which will be discussed in another section.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 50. Framing Square Detail</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a> shows a framing square, containing among other data,
the rafter lengths per foot of run. To use the data pertaining to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">-53-</span>
common or jack rafter lengths, (1) consider the run as 12" taken on
the tongue; (2) select upon the blade along its outer edge the inch
mark which represents the rise of the roof per foot of run required
to give the pitch specified; (3) the number directly below this
mark, reading across the blade in the space marked "Length of
Common Rafter Per Foot of Run" gives the length per foot for
that particular rise or pitch.</p>

<p>As a check for rafter length computations, the following procedure
is suggested: Selecting the run as 12" on the tongue and the
rise in inches per foot of run on the blade, place one square upon another
as shown in <a href="#fig_51">Fig. 51</a>, using that side of the square divided into
inches and twelfths. Do not use the end of the blade, the rounded
corner makes it impossible to secure the accuracy demanded. Extreme
accuracy is required if the constant is to be used for rafters of
considerable length of run. Read the diagonal length between
the numbers representing the run and rise. Read the whole number
of inches as feet, and the fractions as inches, and take off any
fractional remainder upon a very sharp pointed pair of dividers.
Read this divider spacing by means of the hundredths scale on the
framing square. The result should, if the work is very accurately
done, be the same as that obtained by computation from the
tables, even to the hundredths place decimal. Upon ordinary work
where great accuracy is not required carpenters sometimes determine
this constant for a given pitch by placing the framing square
as in <a href="#fig_46">Fig. 46</a> or 47, taking upon the tongue the run and on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">-54-</span>
blade the rise, marking along both tongue and blade. The distance
between these marks is then read on a square placed along
the edge.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp86" id="fig_51" style="max-width: 18.1875em;">
  <img src="images/fig_51.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 51. Finding Rafter Length by Scaling</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Second Method:</i> In determining rafter length, an equally common
practice is to lay the framing square as is shown in <a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45-a</a>.
While in this position
the seat cut is scribed,
cf. Section 18, and also
a short sharp line scribed
along the other member
of the square at the top
edge of the rafter. The
square is moved along,
using the same numbers,
and another advance
mark scribed. This operation
is repeated just
as many times as there
are feet in the run of the
common rafter. With a span of 24' the operation would be
repeated 12 times.</p>

<p>Should the run not happen to be in even feet, the square would
be placed as many times as there were full feet in the run. In
addition it would be advanced that fractional part which the fraction
of the run was of 12". For example, in a run of 12' 7", with a
roof of ¼ pitch, the square would be advanced 12 times using the
number 12 on the tongue and 6 on the blade. In addition to this
the square would be advanced using 7/12 of 12" or 7" on the tongue
and 7/12 of 6" or 3½" on the blade. As these numbers do not
allow enough of the square to rest on the rafter to give a full line,
as soon as the advance limit of rafter length is indicated the square
may be moved up, using the set of numbers first used, that is 12"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">-55-</span>
and 6". On common rafters, this last operation is simplified by
noting that the fractional run, divided by 12, times 12, always
equals itself. The final position of the square, therefore, may be
obtained by simply sliding the member, used in laying out the
last full foot line which parallels the seat cut, an additional distance
equal to the fractional foot of total run, <a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44.</a> The tail
length is obtained similarly, <a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44.</a></p>

Method:</i> Having determined the rafter length as directed in <a href="#sec_17">Sec.

at the plumb cut. The whole number of feet is more safely

or decreased somewhat when an extreme pitch makes it advisable.

<a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>, with the edge of the tongue resting on 3 and scribe a line for

<p>While many carpenters allow end cutting of the rafter tails to
wait until the rafters are set in place so that they may be lined
and cut while in position, certain kinds of work permit the ends
to be cut at the same time the remainder of the rafter is framed.
In this latter method the square is placed as in <a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44</a> and (5) the
end cut scribed. The point of cutoff on the tail is determined in
the same manner as that used in determining rafter length, the run
of the tail being considered and the tail length being measured from
the point 1, <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52.</a></p>

<p>Where a cornice is of unusual width, tails are usually framed
independent of the rafters and are then spiked to the ends of the
rafters either above or below the plate, <a href="#fig_53">Fig. 53.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">-57-</span></p>

<p><i>Second Method:</i> Where the second method of finding length,
Section 17, is employed, the end cut and seat cut will be laid out
before the plumb cut. The operator will stand as in <a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45-a</a>.</p>

<p>When one rafter has been laid out it is cut and used as a pattern
by which to cut similar rafters.</p>

<p><b>19. Ridge Piece.</b>—Roofs may be framed with or without a
ridge piece. The use of a ridge piece makes the assembly or raising
of a roof somewhat easier, especially a hip roof. Upon an ordinary
dwelling a ridge piece is usually a 1" × 6" board. Upon a gabled
roof the length of ridge piece will be the same as that of the plate
which it is to parallel, and will be laid off by placing the ridge board
alongside the plate after the rafter positions have been marked
upon the plate. These marks are transcribed upon the ridge board
by means of the square and pencil.</p>

<p>On a hip roof, <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a>, the length of a ridge piece will be equal
to the length of the parallel plate diminished by the length of the
plate at right angles to this. This, however, is the theoretic length
of ridge as measured from center to center. Enough extra stock
must be left on the ridge when framing it to allow full contact of
hip cheeks. This additional measurement at each end of the ridge
will be equal to ½ the diagonal thickness of the hip plus ½ the
thickness of the ridge, <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a>, making a total addition equal to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">-58-</span>
diagonal thickness of the hip plus the thickness of the ridge.
<a href="#fig_55">Fig. 55</a> illustrates the placing of the square to determine the diagonal
thickness of a hip rafter
which strikes the ridge at an
angle of 45 degrees.</p>

Method:</i> The line of measurement for length of a hip and
valley rafter is along the middle of the back or top edge, as on
common and jack rafters. The manner of determining the number
to use on the tongue of the square as a constant for the run, in
terms of the 12" constant run of the common rafter, when the rise
of the hip or valley rafter per foot of common run is taken on the
blade; and the manner of constructing a table of unit lengths of hip
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">-59-</span>
and valley rafter, per foot of run of common rafter, are illustrated
in Figs. <a href="#fig_57">57</a>, <a href="#fig_58a">58</a>, <a href="#fig_59">59</a> and <a href="#fig_60">60</a>. From a study of these illustrations it
will be seen that a hip or valley rafter of a square cornered building
is in either case the diagonal of a square prism which has for its
base dimensions the tangent and run of the roof, and for its height
the rise of the roof, <a href="#fig_57">Fig. 57.</a> On a square cornered building the
run and tangent are always equal.</p>

  <img src="images/fig_59.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 59. Determining Unit Length of Hip

</figure>

<p>The length of the
diagonal of the base of
such a prism, which is
the run of the hip or
valley rafter, is found
by the formula
<i>c'²</i> = <i>a'²</i> + <i>b'²</i>, <a href="#fig_58a">Fig. 58.</a>
When tangent and run
are equal and each
taken as 12", the run of
the hip or valley equals
16.97", which for practical
purposes of carpentry is considered as 17". In laying on the
square, then, in framing a hip or valley rafter of a square cornered
building, 17" will be taken upon the tongue, the rise of the roof per
foot of run of common rafter or per 17" of run of hip or valley rafter,
being taken on the blade.</p>

<p>The table of hip and valley lengths per foot of run of common
rafter, <a href="#fig_60">Fig. 60</a>, will be formed by solving the right triangle
<i>c²</i> = <i>a′²</i> + <i>b′²</i>, <a href="#fig_59">Fig. 59</a>, for each of the pitches represented.</p>

<p>The positions to be assumed by the worker in framing a hip
or valley rafter are similar to those to be assumed in framing the
common rafter.</p>

<p>In measuring the length of a hip or valley rafter by the first
method, the plumb cut may be laid off first. The upper end of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">-60-</span>
hip rafter will have to be framed with a side cut as shown in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61.</a>
The measurement for length will be made from a point along the
middle of the top arris. Where the second method is employed,
the end and seat cuts are laid off first.</p>

<p><b>21. Laying off Plumb Cut of Hip or Valley Rafter for Square
Cornered Buildings.</b>—Assuming a position with reference to the
rafter similar to that in framing the common rafter, lay off the
plumb cut using 17" on the tongue, and on the blade the rise per
foot of run of the roof, or common rafter, which is also the rise of a
hip or valley on that roof per 17" of hip or valley run. Scribe along
the blade.</p>

</figure>

<p><b>22. Side or Cheek Cut of Hip or Valley Rafter.</b>—<i>First
Method:</i> There are a number of ways to lay out a side cut on a
square cornered building. The simplest to remember, where no
framing tables are at hand, consists in measuring square back from
the plumb cut line a distance <i>A-B</i>, <a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62</a>, equal to the thickness
of the rafter being framed. Thru this point lay off another line
parallel to the plumb cut line and "carry" this across the top edge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">-61-</span>
of the rafter with the square, as at <i>D-E</i>. Now adjust the bevel to
pass thru <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>, <a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62</a>, and the setting is obtained for all side
cuts of hip or valley rafters of that pitch of roof. Scribe this line on
the top edge of the rafter. Carry it down the remaining side
using the same numbers on the square as were used in laying off
the plumb cut on the first side.</p>

<p><i>Second Method:</i> This method of laying off side or cheek cut
consists in laying the framing square across the top edge of the
rafter, taking 17" on the tongue and the length of hip or valley
rafter per foot of run of common rafter for the pitch required on
the blade, and scribing along the blade.</p>

</figure>

<p><b>23. Determining Length of Hip or Valley Rafter.</b>—<i>First
Method:</i> If a table of unit lengths of hip or valley per foot of run of
common rafter is available, <a href="#fig_60">Fig. 60</a>, the total rafter length may be
determined by multiplying the unit of hip or valley rafter length
per foot of run of common rafter by the total run of common rafter.
Do not make the mistake of trying to multiply by the run of the
hip or valley rafter. Remember that these tables are all worked
out with the 12" run of the common rafter as the base. This is
true no matter whether the house is four sided, eight sided, or any
other number of sides. The respective tables are based in every
case upon 12" run of the common rafter.</p>

<p>Measurements for lengths of hip or valley are to be made along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">-62-</span>
the top edge of the stock beginning at the line for side cut and
midway between the point and heel, <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61.</a></p>

<p><i>Second Method:</i> This method of determining length of a hip or
valley rafter is not unlike the second method described for the common
rafter. Here, the numbers are 17 on the tongue, and the rise
per foot of run of roof or of common rafter, on the blade. The end
and seat cuts are scribed, after which the square is advanced step
by step, using these same numbers,
as many times as there are
feet of run of common rafter.
Should there be a fraction of a
foot in the run of common rafter
an additional and proportional
advancement must be made.
For example, to frame a hip
for a square roof of ¼ pitch,
having a run of common rafter of 12' 7". Advance the framing
square 12 times, using 17" on the tongue and 6" on the blade. For
the fractional advance take 1/12 of 17" or 9-11/12" (the framing
square is laid off in twelfths on one side) on the tongue and 7/12 of 6"
or 3½" on the blade, and scribe the limit. Fractional foot length
of tail will be determined in a similar manner, the run or
horizontal extension, or the lookout, of the common rafter determining
the number of times the square must be advanced using
17" and 6" for the above given pitch.</p>

<p id="sec_24"><b>24. Laying off Seat and End Cut of Hip Rafter for Square

be laid off in a manner quite similar to that used in laying off the

There will be this difference, of course; the numbers to be used on
the square will be 17" on the tongue instead of 12" as in the case
of the common rafter. The rise per foot of run will be the same as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">-63-</span>

will be advanced. The distance 1-3, <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>, must be the same on
hip and valley as on common rafter of the same pitch of roof. The

the end cut, <a href="#fig_63">Fig. 63.</a> Since these cuts
are identical with the side cut at the
upper end of hip or valley, the square
may be used as in laying off a side cut,
cf. Section 22, second method.</p>

<p><b>25. Reduction of Hip or Valley
Rafter Length Because of Ridge
Piece.</b>—If a hip rafter of a square cornered building is to be
framed against a ridge piece, <a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a>, its length must be reduced
correspondingly. To make such allowance, measure square back
from the line of plumb cut a distance equal to ½ the diagonal
thickness of the ridge, <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61-A-B</a>.</p>

<p><b>26. Backing a Hip Rafter for Square Cornered Building.</b>—<i>First
Method:</i> Since the line of measurement of a hip rafter is along
the center of the top edge, if the rafter is framed with the same
plumb distance as was given the common rafters, 1-3, <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>, it
stands to reason that the roof boards will not fit the top edge of the
hip properly until the arrises of the hip have been removed as in
the cross-section of <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64.</a> The laying out and removal of these
arrises is known as backing the hip.</p>

<p>The amount of backing for a hip rafter will depend upon the
rafter thickness, the pitch of the roof, and the number of sides to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">-64-</span>
the plate, and is indicated by gage lines on either side and one on
the top edge of the rafter. To determine the location of these gage
lines on the sides of the rafter, (1) place the square on the hip as in
laying out the seat cut for the hip on which the backing is to be
placed, the constant, 17", on the tongue and the rise on the blade,
if the house is rectangular, <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64.</a> (2) Measure from the edge of
the hip back along the tongue a distance equal to % the thickness
of the rafter, and mark. This point gives the setting for the gage.
(3) Gage both sides of the rafter and then remove the arrises as
shown in the cross-section. Carpenters more frequently frame a
hip without backing, allowing the roof boards to rest upon the arrises
of the hip, forming a small triangular space between the roof boards
and the top edge of the hip. In order to keep these arrises in the
same planes as the tops of the common rafters, they must reduce the
plumb height 1-3, <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>, of the hip. The amount of reduction,
that is, the amount of drop the hip must make is equal to the
plumb height of the backing, <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64.</a></p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">-65-</span>
of run of common rafter on the blade; scribe along the tongue to
get the angle of backing.</p>

<p><b>27. Valley Rafters.</b>—As has been indicated in previous sections
of the text, valley rafters have their lengths, plumb cuts, and
seat cuts determined like hip rafters.</p>

<p>There is one difference; the valley rafter at its seat must be
framed as in <a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65</a> in order that the plumb line may come directly
over the corner of the building. The ends of roof boards will rest
upon the valley rafter at its center line, which line is in the same
plane as that of the common rafters.</p>

<p>Like the hip rafter, the upper end may be laid out first, after
which the rafter length is measured from this, the measurement
being made along the middle of the back of the rafter, the top
edge.</p>

<p>To lay out the cuts shown in <a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65-a</a>, proceed as in laying out
the end of a hip rafter, as described in <a href="#sec_24">Sec. 24</a>, <a href="#fig_63">Fig. 63.</a> In the case
of an octagon the amount would be 5/12 of that used for the square,
Fig. 65-b.</p>

<p>In Figs. <a href="#fig_40">40</a> and <a href="#fig_41">41</a> is shown a valley rafter framed thru to the
ridge. This is done to give the valley support, for a valley, unlike
a hip, is not self supporting when the jacks are attached. Against
this valley rafter is framed a second valley rafter. The upper end
of this second valley rafter is framed with a plumb cut such as
would be given a hip or valley of the same rise and run; the end,
however, is cut square across as in the case of a common rafter
resting against a ridge.</p>

<p><b>28. Framing the Jack Rafter for Square Cornered Buildings;
Plumb Cut; Side Cut.</b>—Jack rafters which have their top ends
framed against a hip are known as hip jacks; those having the lower
ends framed against a valley are known as valley jacks; those which
are framed in between hip and valley are known as cripple jacks.</p>

<p>The jack rafter, being but a portion of a common rafter, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">-66-</span>
framed in a manner quite like that used in framing the common
rafter. The chief difference is in the fact that the jack rafter has a
side or cheek cut, and that the lengths of jacks vary with their position
along the plate. The order of procedure may be: (1) To lay
off the plumb cut, just as for a common rafter having the same rise,
that is, using 12" on the tongue, and the rise per foot of run on the
blade; scribe along the blade. (2) Lay off the side cut or cheek cut.
This is done just as in laying off the side cut of the hip rafter on a
square cornered building, first method only, <a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62.</a> Where a
table of common rafter lengths per foot of run is available, <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>, a
second method of laying out the side cut of a jack rafter consists
in taking 12" on the tongue of the framing square, and the common
rafter length per foot of run for the pitch given, on the blade; laying
the square across the edge of the rafter and scribing along the
blade. (3) Lay off the length of the jack as determined in the next
section. (4) Lay off the seat cut just as in laying off the seat cut
of the common rafter for the same pitch of roof, Section 18. Equally
common is the practice of beginning with the end and seat cuts.</p>

<p>The framing square of <a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a> contains data which makes
possible the laying out of side cuts for the square cornered building
by means of numbers taken upon tongue and blade.</p>

<p>While the ratios of the numbers used upon the tongue and the
blade are always the same for any given pitch, different makers
of squares use different numbers for side cuts. The student will
have to have special directions for each different make of square.
These may be gotten from the manufacturers.</p>

<p><b>29. Lengths of Jack Rafters for Square Cornered Roofs.</b>—<i>First
Method:</i> The framing table for common rafters and jack
rafters, <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>, may be made use of in determining lengths of jacks.
To make use of this table we shall need to know the run of each
separate jack. An examination of <a href="#fig_66">Fig. 66</a> shows that in a rectangular
house the run of a jack is the same as the length of plate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">-67-</span>
or of ridge which forms the angle. This is true of hip jack, valley
jack, or cripple jack. However, such measurements are along the
centers of the top edges of the rafters and allowance must be made
in the length of the jacks for the thickness of hip or valley rafter.
In the case of the cripple jack this amount of reduction will be
equal to ½ the diagonal thickness of the hip plus ½ the diagonal
thickness of the valley, measured at right angles to the plumb cut,
<a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>, or measured in the plane of the plate, or a parallel plane.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp88" id="fig_66" style="max-width: 19.8125em;">
  <img src="images/fig_66.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 66. Lengths of Jack Rafters.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Top and bottom
ends of cripples are
alike, but in nailing
them in place the
lower ends must be
held up so that their
center lines will strike
the center of the
valley rafter. Their
tops will be kept even
with the outer arrises
of the hip whether the
hip is backed or not.</p>

<p>In determining the true length of hip jack and valley jack
we should know that a reduction of ½ the diagonal thickness of
hip or valley, measured straight back from the plumb cut, is to be
made. In the case of a valley jack resting against a ridge piece,
an additional reduction must be made as described in Section 19,
<a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56.</a> In actual practice carpenters usually measure the length
of hip or valley jack from the long point, along the arris, instead
of along the center of the top edge, no reduction being made for ½
the diagonal thickness of hip or valley. Cripple jacks are measured
from long point to long point, no reduction being made for
thickness of hip and valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">-68-</span></p>

  <img src="images/fig_67.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 67. Determining Length of
Jack Rafters</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Second Method:</i> Where jacks are framed so that equal spacings
may be laid off, beginning with a full length common rafter, as
in <a href="#fig_67">Fig. 67</a>, the simplest method of determining lengths of jacks
is to first count the number of spaces between jacks, which must be
laid off on ridge or on plate, and divide the length of common
rafter by this number. The
result will be the common difference
between lengths of jacks.
The longest jack will be framed
first by reducing the length of
common rafter by the common
difference. The next, by reducing
the jack just framed by the
common difference, etc. This
method is applicable to roofs of
any number of sides.</p>

<p><i>Third Method:</i> If we begin
to frame with the shortest jack
instead of the longest, we first determine the length of the shortest
jack, remembering that its run in the square cornered building will
be the same as its spacing from the corner along the plate, or along
the ridge in case of a valley jack. In a similar manner the second
jack can be framed. The difference in the lengths of these two
is the common difference. To the length of this second jack, and
to each succeeding jack add the common difference, to get the
length of the next.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Method:</i> As rafters are usually spaced either 16" or 24"
apart, a table consisting of the common differences in lengths for
the various pitches will be found convenient, <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49.</a> The steel
square of <a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a> also shows such a table for the square roof.</p>

</figure>

<p id="sec_30"><b>30. Tangents; Miter Cuts of the Plate.</b>—Before the principles
involved in the laying out of rafters on any type of roof can
be understood, a clearer idea of the term tangent as used in roof
framing must be had. A tangent of an angle of a right triangle is
the ratio or fractional value obtained by dividing the value of the
side opposite that angle by the value of the adjacent side. The
tangent at the plate, to which reference was made is the tangent
of the angle having for its adjacent sides the run of the common
rafter and the run of the hip or valley. By making use of a circle
with a radius of 12" we may represent the value of this tangent
graphically in terms of the constant of common rafter run, <a href="#fig_68">Fig. 68.</a>
By constructing these figures very carefully and measuring the
line marked tangent, we may obtain the value of the tangent for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">-70-</span>
the polygon measured in inches to the foot of run of the common
rafter. Such measurements, if made to the 1/100 of an inch will
serve all practical purposes. A safer way, however, is to make
use of values secured thru the trigonometric solutions described in
Appendix I, using the graphic solutions as checks. The values of
tangents at intervals of one degree are given in the Table of Natural
Functions, Appendix II. By interpolation, fractional degree
values may be found.</p>

  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;of any number of sides.<br>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a> is illustrated a handy device one side of which, by the
twirling of one disk within the other, can be made to give tangent
values, in terms of a 12" base, for any number of degrees. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">-71-</span>
reverse side of this "key" gives data to be used in the framing of
square cornered and octagonal roofs. Such a key will be found a
convenient way in which to carry needed data and should be easily
understood and intelligently used, once the principles discussed
in this chapter are mastered. An explanation of the author's key,
<a href="#fig_70-a">Fig. 70</a>, will be found in Appendix IV.</p>

<p>Now as to some of the uses for tangent values: First, by taking
12" on the tongue and the tangent value in inches per foot of
common rafter run upon the blade of the square, we are able to get
the lay-out for the miter joint of the plate.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_71-b">Fig. 71-b</a> illustrates the square placed for the lay-out of the
octagonal plate or sill miter. Five inches is taken as tangent since
the real value 4.97" is equivalent to 5" for all practical purposes.</p>

<p>For the square cornered building 12" and 12" would be used in
making the plate miter lay-out, since the tangent of 45 is 1 according
to the Table, Appendix II. Any other like numbers would give
a tangent value of 1, of course, but it is best to consider 12" on the
tongue, in which case 12" must be taken on the blade.</p>

<p>Second, this tangent value is needed in determining the cheek
or side cut of hip, valley and jack rafters, as will be shown in
<a href="#sec_35">Sec. 35</a>.</p>

<p>Third, this tangent value is needed in determining the amount
of backing to be given hip rafters. This is discussed in <a href="#sec_39">Sec. 39</a>.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the plate miter in degrees is required. This
is determined for any regular polygon by the proposition: The
plate or miter angle of any regular polygon = 90 - (central angle/2)</p>

<p>Fourth, the tangent value is needed in finding the length of a
side of a polygon, the span or run of the polygon being known, and
vice versa. Length of side = span x tangent of plate, using 12"
as base.</p>

<p><b>31. Octagonal Roofs.</b>—While the square cornered building is
the most common, the octagon is frequently used in the form of a
bay attached to the side of a house. The octagon is also common
upon silos and towers. The manner of finding the run, tangent,
length of hip and valley rafter, miter cut of plate or sill, the manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">-74-</span>
of determining the numbers to use on the square to lay out the
plumb and seat cuts, etc., will be found developed herein for both
square and octagonal roof. Having mastered the principles involved
in these two forms, the student should be able to work out
framing problems for roofs of any number of sides.</p>

<p><b>32. Common Rafter for Plate of any Number of Sides.</b>—By
referring to Figs. <a href="#fig_68">68</a> and <a href="#fig_72">72</a> it will be seen that common rafters have
for their runs the apothem of the
polygon made by the plate, represented
in <a href="#fig_68">Fig. 68</a> by the lines
<i>b, b’, b″</i>. The run of the hip is
represented by the line <i>c, c′, c″</i>.
The rise will be found the same
for full length common rafters and hips.
Plumb and seat cuts and lengths per
foot of run of common rafters and jacks
are determined for a building of any
number of sides just as for the square
cornered building. The degree of inclination
of common and jack rafter is
applicable, too, <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49.</a></p>

the octagonal hip, valley, or jack 5" must be taken upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">-77-</span>
blade, since that is the tangent value of 22½°, 12" as base being
taken on the tongue, <a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74-b</a>. This tangent value will vary,
then, according to the change in the junction angle.</p>

<p>Securing Value of A-B of <a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>, Various Angles]</p>

<p>The reason for using the tangent and run for this work is indicated
by the position of the square on the plan of the roof, <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75.</a>
These figures are for use only when the timbers lie in the plane
of the plate, or any parallel plane. When rafters take on pitch or
rise, however, the upward projection of the plan of the miter cut,
<a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>, will determine the side cut as just described.</p>

<p><b>36. Rafter Lengths of Octagonal and other Polygonal Hips and
Valleys.</b>—<i>First Method:</i> Knowing the run of a hip or valley for the
polygon under consideration (17" for the square, 13" for the
octagon, etc.), by assuming the respective rises for the various
pitches and solving <i>c′²</i> = <i>a′²</i> + <i>b²'</i>, <a href="#fig_76">Fig. 76</a>, data pertaining to hip or
valley unit rafter lengths, such as that for the octagon in <a href="#fig_73">Fig. 73</a>,
is obtained.</p>

<p>To determine a rafter length, having available such a table,
multiply the hip or valley length per foot of run of common rafter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">-78-</span>
as given in the table by the run of the common rafter of that roof.
Reduce to feet. Such lengths will be laid off by measurement from
the side or cheek cut, which will
have been laid off, down the top
edge of the rafter.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp40" id="fig_76" style="max-width: 15.125em;">
  <img src="images/fig_76.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 76. King-Post</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Lengths of hip or valley tails
will be determined in a similar
manner from the same table.</p>

<p><i>Second Method:</i> This consists
in successive placings of the
square, using the same numbers
on tongue and blade as will be
used in laying out the plumb
cut for this particular roof. The
successive advances will be determined,
as in the hip or valley
of a square cornered building, by
the number of feet in the run of
the common rafter of this roof.
A fractional part of a foot in run
will be treated in a manner similar
to that described for the square
cornered building. Suitable
allowance must be made for the fact that the length of rafter is
along the middle of the top edge of the rafter, when this latter
method is used.</p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Example:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;An octagonal roof of ¼ pitch has a span of 25′.<br>
  &#160;&#160;The run of common rafter = 12' 6".<br>
  &#160;&#160;Taking 13" on the tongue and 6" on the blade lay off<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;successively 12 measurements. Take 6/12 or ½ of 13" or 6½"<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;on the tongue and 6/12 or ½ of 6" or 3" on the blade for<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the fractional footof run.<br>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">-79-</span></p>

<p><b>37. Reductions in Lengths for King-Post.</b>—Suitable reduction
must be made for king-post, should there be one, <a href="#fig_76">Fig. 76</a>, or for
rafter thicknesses should no king-post be used, <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75-b</a>. Where
a king-post is used the reduction will be ½ the width of the square
out of which the king-post is formed, the measurement being made
square back from the line of the plumb cut, as in reducing common
rafter lengths for ridge piece, <a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56.</a></p>

<p>Where an apex is formed as in <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75-b</a>, one pair of hips is
framed each with a run equal to ½ the octagon's diagonal, with cuts
at the top the same as those of common rafters. The second pair
will be similarly framed but the lengths will each be reduced an
amount equal to ½ the thickness of the first pair, measuring
straight back from the plumb cut. The third and fourth pairs will
be reduced an amount equal to ½ the diagonal thickness of the
rafters already framed, measured straight back from the plumb
cut, Figs. <a href="#fig_74">74-a</a> and <a href="#fig_75">75-b</a>. These rafters will have to have double
side cuts as indicated in <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75-b</a>. It will be noted that these
latter rafters meet the others at an angle of 45 degrees, making the
framing of the side cut similar to that of a square cornered building
except that these are given double cheeks.</p>

<p><b>38. Seat and End Cut of Octagonal and other Polygonal Hips
and Valleys.</b>—The method of procedure in laying out the seat
and end cuts of octagonal and other polygonal hips and valleys is
similar to that described for the square hip, except of course, the
numbers to use on the square will differ. These numbers will be
determined by the run of the hip for that particular roof, and by
the rise in inches per foot of run of common rafter. In the case
of the octagon the numbers will be 13" on the tongue, and the rise
on the blade. The length of tail may be figured by the tables, if
such are available, or the framing square may be advanced successively
as many times as there are feet in the run of the tail or the
lookout of the common rafter of that roof, as heretofore described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">-80-</span></p>

<p>The miter cut on the end of a hip rafter and in the crotch of a
valley rafter will vary with the tangent value of the plate. For the
octagon, whose tangent is 5" the measurement from the end cut
and at right angles to it will be 5/12 that used on the square cornered
building. This same ratio will hold for the measurement at the
crotch of the valley, <a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65-b</a>.</p>

<p id="sec_39"><b>39. Backing Octagonal and other Hips.</b>—The principle
involved in determining the amount of backing on hip rafters for
the octagon, as well as that of other polygons,
is similar to that for backing hips for
the square cornered building.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp75" id="fig_77" style="max-width: 13.6875em;">
  <img src="images/fig_77.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 77. Laying out Backing for Octagon Hip</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>(1) Place the framing square upon
the hip as for making the seat cut
of the octagon hip rafter, <a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77.</a></p>

<p>(2) Referring to <a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a> it will
be seen that the more sides a roof
possesses the less will be the backing
required. <a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a> represents the
hips on square, octagon, and
hexagon as they would appear upon
the plan if made to stand straight up at the corners of the
plates. The backing in each case is determined by the tangent
of the angle whose adjacent side is ½ the rafter thickness, and
whose angle is equivalent to ½ the central angle as <i>A, A′, A″</i>,
<a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78.</a> The fact that the hips are inclined and not vertical in
their final position in a roof makes no difference in the principle of
determining backing because of the fact that our measurements
are made in a horizontal plane, or in the plane of the plate, Figs. <a href="#fig_64">64</a>
and <a href="#fig_77">77</a>.</p>

<p>The ratio of the backing of the octagon or any other polygonal
hip to that of the square of equal rise will be proportional to their
tangent values. For illustration, on the square roof we measured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">-81-</span>
along the tongue of the square, from the top edge of the hip, <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64</a>,
½ the thickness of the rafter, for reasons made plain in <a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78.</a>
In laying off the octagon backing we should lay off along the
tongue in the line of the octagon seat cut, 5/12 of ½ the thickness of
the rafter. In the case of a 2" rafter, 5/12" will be set off, using that
side of the square containing graduations in 12ths.</p>

<p>(3) Where backing is not desired the rafter will be dropped a
plumb distance equal to the plumb distance of the backing of the
rafter, <a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77.</a> Consult <a href="#fig_73">Fig. 73.</a></p>

<p><b>40. Framing the Octagonal and other Polygonal Jacks.</b>—Plumb
cuts of jacks are determined by the rise and run of the common
rafter of that particular roof. The seat cuts will be determined
by the same numbers. Side cuts, end cuts, and lengths of
jacks are determined as described in Sections 41 and 42.</p>

<p><b>41. Side Cut of Octagonal and other Polygonal Jacks.</b>—<i>First
Method:</i> The method described in Section 35 is applicable to jacks
as well.</p>

<p><i>Second Method:</i> If a table of common rafter lengths per foot of
run is available, the side cut of any polygonal jack may be laid
out by placing the framing square across the top of the rafter,
taking the tangent value of the polygon on the tongue, and the
length of common rafter per foot of run on the blade, and scribing
on the blade. The tangent of the polygon forms the opposite side
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">-82-</span>
of a triangle in which the adjacent side is the length of common or
jack rafter per foot of run. The angle formed being the angle of
side cut of jack.</p>

<p id="sec_42"><b>42. Lengths of Octagonal and other Polygonal Jacks.</b>—The
methods of procedure in determining the lengths of jacks for
other than square cornered buildings differs from that described
for the square cornered building only in the fact that the runs,
hence lengths, of the jacks must be determined differently. An
examination of Figs. <a href="#fig_68">68</a> and <a href="#fig_72">72</a> will show that the runs, hence the
lengths, of jacks for the square, the octagon, etc., when the run of
common rafter is the same, will vary inversely as the tangent ratio.
For example, the tangent of the square is 12" when its run of common
rafter is 12", while that of the octagon is 4.97" or practically
5". The runs, and, therefore, the lengths of octagon jacks will
differ one with reference to another, 12/5 of those of the jacks for the
square building. If an octagon jack rests 24" from the corner, its
run, and therefore its length, will be 12/5 times that of a jack on a
square cornered building similarly placed.</p>

<p><i>Second Method:</i> Difference in lengths of jacks may be determined
by counting the spacings along the plate and dividing the
length of common rafter by that number.</p>

<p><b>43. Framing by Means of a Protractor.</b>—By means of a protractor
used in connection with the columns containing degree
measurements, Figs. <a href="#fig_49">49</a>, <a href="#fig_60">60</a>, and <a href="#fig_73">73</a>, roof framing may be greatly
simplified.</p>

<p>To lay off a seat cut, it is merely necessary to look in the table
of hip, valley, jack, or common rafter, whatever is being framed,
and read the degree of inclination of rafter for the pitch required.
The blade of a T-bevel is set by means of the protractor to this
angle; or a combination tool may be used, and the tool applied as
in <a href="#fig_79-80">Fig. 79.</a></p>

<p>The plumb cut and seat cut are complementary. Since a protractor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">-83-</span>
is made to read in either of two directions, the plumb cut
setting may be got by adding to or subtracting from 90 degrees
the angle of inclination of that rafter. With a combination tool,
one setting of the tool serves to lay out both seat and plumb cut.</p>

<p>The degree of setting for a side or cheek cut, the gage setting
for backing, and the amount of drop where no backing is used will
be found under appropriate columns in the tables referred to above.
The manner of applying the combination tool for laying out plumb
cut, seat cut, side cut and end cut is indicated in Figs. <a href="#fig_79-80">79</a>, <a href="#fig_79-80">80</a>, <a href="#fig_81-82">81</a>
and <a href="#fig_81-82">82</a>. The manner of determining the data found in these tables
is a matter of trigonometric solution, no more difficult than that
already given, and omitted for lack of space. Such problems may
well form a part of the pupil's work in mathematics.</p>

<p>For Example: Data for side cuts of jack, hip and valley for
square and octagonal roofs will be found in Figs. <a href="#fig_49">49</a>, <a href="#fig_60">60</a>, and <a href="#fig_73">73</a>.
In these tables will be found a column marked "Degree of side cut
of hip or valley," also of jack. To secure the angle of side cut it is
only necessary to solve by simple trigonometric formulæ, the
triangle <i>a b c</i> and then <i>a′ b′ c′</i> of <a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62.</a> The angle <i>A</i> is the angle
of inclination of hip or jack or valley, and will be found for each
inch of rise in the tables; the manner of determining the same
having been described. The side <i>b</i> is <i>A-B</i> of <a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>, the value of
which is also easily determined once the principles of <a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a> are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">-84-</span>
mastered. With this data the student may find the angle <i>A'</i> of
<a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62</a> as given in the tables.</p>

<p>Rafter lengths are determined as previously described in connection
with framing with the steel square.</p>

<p><b>44. Translating Framing Problems from Protractor to Framing
Square and Vice Versa.</b>—Frequently it is desirable to translate
framing problems from degrees to numbers to be used upon the
steel square, and vice versa. To change from degree framing to
steel square framing it is only necessary to remember that the
numbers to use on the square must be numbers such that their
ratio one to the other shall give a tangent value equal to that given
in the Table of Natural Functions, Appendix II, for the angle under
consideration.</p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Example:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;Given: Angle of inclination of common rafter or of roof = 30 degrees.<br>
  &#160;&#160;Find the numbers to take on the square to frame seat and plumb cuts.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;Tan 30° = .577 (by Table, Appendix II).<br>
  &#160;&#160;By agreement, run of common rafter takes 12" on one member of the<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;square for constant of run.<br>
  &#160;&#160;Therefore, rise must be 6.93", or 611/12", must be taken on the other<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;member of the square. (The base of the table is 1 so that for<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;12" run we must have 12" x .5774.)
</div>

<p>In a similar manner the number to be taken on the blade, when
the inclination of any other common or jack rafter is given, may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">-85-</span>
determined. In the case of the hip or valley inclination, however,
it must be remembered that 17" is to be taken on the tongue for
the run in the square cornered house, with 13" in the octagon, which
will necessitate multiplying the tangent value of the angle of inclination
by 17 and 13 respectively to find the number to take on
the blade when one or the other of these is taken on the tongue.</p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Example:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;Given: Side cut of jack rafter, or hip or valley = 38 degrees.<br>
  &#160;&#160;Find the numbers to use on the framing square to lay off this<br>
  &#160;&#160;same angle.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;Tan 38° = .7813<br>
  &#160;&#160;By agreement, we shall take 12" on the tongue.<br>
  &#160;&#160;The number to be taken on the blade must be, therefore,<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;12" x .7813 = 9⅜<br>
  &#160;&#160;(In the case of the side cut, any number other than 12" might have<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;been assumed on the tongue.)<br>
<br>
  <i>Example:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;Given: A hip rafter on a square roof which is framed with 17" on the<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;tongue and 8" on the blade.<br>
  &#160;&#160;To find the angle of inclination of the hip.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;8/17 = .4706<br>

<p><b>45. Framing an Octagon Bay.</b>—Whatever may be one's
opinion as to the propriety of the octagon bay architecturally, its
very common use makes it obligatory upon the builder to know
how to properly frame it.</p>

<p>Referring to Figs. <a href="#fig_72">72</a> and <a href="#fig_83-a">83-a</a> it will be seen that the octagon
bay is but a portion of a full octagon set up against the side of a
house. From this it follows that the framing of the plate, sills,
the laying out of plumb and seat cuts, and side or cheek cuts of
jacks that rest against hips, etc., will be according to principles discussed
in previous sections of the text. The chief thing which
needs explanation is the matter of laying out side cuts for hips and
jacks which are to rest against the side of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">-86-</span></p>

</table>

<p>Consider the bay as cut along the line <i>I-J</i>, <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83-a</a>. To frame
the hip nearest the building: (1) Determine the angle which would
give the side or cheek cut of the rafter involved when the rafter
has no pitch, that is, when it lies in the plane of the plate. <a href="#fig_83">Fig.
83-a</a> indicates the manner of determining this angle, which will be
found to be 22½°. If we wish to use a framing square instead
of a framing tool we may readily translate the 22½°. We shall
find that 12" taken on the tongue of the square will require 4.97"
or 5" on the blade. (2) Place the square as in <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83-b</a> and scribe
along the tongue. Remember that this gives the miter when the
rafter lies in the plane of the plate. This would give the cut to be
used where ceiling joist or floor joist of octagon bay are run parallel
with the rafters. On small bays, joists are seldom run thus but are
run parallel with other joists of the house. No special directions
are needed for setting the protractor, or the combination tool, the
manner of setting and placing is so obvious. (3) Once having
this miter when the rafter lies in the plane of the plate, proceed as
directed in <a href="#sec_35">Sec. 35</a>, (2) <i>et seq.</i> With one such rafter framed the
mates may be laid out by transposition.</p>

<p>To frame the remaining hips of <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83-a</a> proceed in a manner
similar to that just described. In this case the angle made by the
hip when it lies in the plane of the plate and the side of the house
will be 67½° degrees. Why? <a href="#fig_84-a-b">Fig. 84-a</a>. The framing tool
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">-87-</span>
or protractor and T-bevel provide the simplest means of framing.
If one wishes to use the framing square he will find that by using
the tangent value of 67½° he gets 28.97" to take on the blade
when 12" is taken on the tongue. This he cannot find, of course.
He may either take other smaller numbers having the same
ratio, or he might better take the cotangent value of 67½°. Cot
of an angle of a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the
opposite side.</p>

<p>(1) Place the square as in <a href="#fig_84-a-b">Fig. 84-b</a> and scribe along the blade.
By this time the student should have observed that the tangent
value of any angle
increases as the
cotangent value of
the angle decreases
and vice versa. Note
that when a cotangent
value is used,
12" is still taken on
the tongue and the
same number as for
the tangent value of
that number of degrees is taken on the
blade, but that the scribing is done along the blade and not
along the tongue as is the case when tangent values are used.
(2) Proceed from this point as in <a href="#sec_35">Sec. 35</a>, (2) <i>et seq.</i></p>

square as in <a href="#fig_85-a-b">Fig. 85-b</a> and scribe along the tongue. (3) From this
on, continue as in <a href="#sec_35">Sec. 35</a>, (2) <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>From these solutions the student should be able to generalize
sufficiently to care for rafters of any angle of intersection with the
side of a building, and of any pitch. The use of the framing
tool or protractor and T-square is strongly recommended upon
such work as this. Nothing but tradition prevents its more general
use in carpentry. Having determined the lay-out for the side cut
of these rafters, the length of each must next be determined. To
determine the length of hip or jack intercepted by the side of the
house and the plate: (1) Determine the run of the intercepted part
of the common or jack rafter, as <i>b</i>, <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83-a</a>. (2) By means of the
table of rafter lengths per foot of run compute the length of rafter
under consideration.</p>

<p>In determining the run of an intercepted part it is necessary to
have data concerning the size of the octagon and the amount
cut off by the building. The lines <i>E-D</i> and <i>F-D</i>, <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83-a</a>, when
dimensioned, give this data. The actual lengths of the various
hips, jacks, etc., in practical carpentry, upon small bays, are usually
determined by actual measurement from the plate or sill to the
proper point of intersection on the building as indicated by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">-89-</span>
stick or extension rule held at the proper angle. Sometimes a
large scale drawing is made and the runs taken from this. Upon
large work where accuracy is necessary and measurements impossible,
trigonometric solutions should be used.</p>

<p>To determine the length of the intercepted hip rafter over <i>c</i>
of triangle <i>a b c</i> <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83-a</a>, the value of <i>b</i> must first be secured.</p>

<p>This value represents common rafter run for hip rafter rising
over side <i>c</i>, and run of intercepted common rafter rising over side <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Length of intercepted hip rising over side <i>c</i> = <i>b x</i> unit length of
hip. (Table of lengths of octagon hips in terms of run of common
rafter, <a href="#fig_73">Fig. 73.</a>)</p>

<p>Length of intercepted common rafter or jack nearest house =
<i>b x</i> unit length of common rafter. (Table of lengths of common
rafter in terms of run of common rafter, <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49.</a>)</p>

<p>It must be remembered that these are theoretic lengths measured
down the middle of the top edge of the rafters. In framing,
suitable reductions must be made. For example, in framing the
intercepted common rafter nearest the building, the rafter must be
set over one-half its thickness that it may be nailed against the side
of the building. The allowance necessary in order to do this may
be secured by measuring the length from the long point instead of
the middle of the side or cheek cut. Suitable reduction, too, must
be made for the hip thickness in this case one-half the diagonal
across the top edge of the hip, laid off at an angle of 22½°, or 5"
and 12" on the square. This amount will be laid off straight back
from the plumb cut, <a href="#sec_35">Sec. 35</a>, (2) <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>Length of hip must be measured along the middle of the top
of the rafter.</p>

<p><b>46. Framing a Roof of One Pitch to Another of Different
Pitch.</b>—Occasionally one must frame a roof of one pitch against
a roof of another pitch. To determine the cut, if the combination
tool is to be used, merely find the difference in degrees of the angles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">-90-</span>
of inclination of the two rafters, and apply the tool as indicated in
the tables for making any other plumb cut, Figs. <a href="#fig_49">49</a>, <a href="#fig_60">60</a> and <a href="#fig_73">73</a>.
The seat cut will be determined by the rise and run of the shed
rafter in the usual manner.</p>

</figure>

<p>Where the framing square is to be used, lay the square as in
framing a plumb cut on the shed rafter, as at <i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>, taking on
the tongue, the run, and on the blade the rise of the shed rafter.
Next lay a second square as at <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>, taking on the blade the
rise and on the tongue the
run of the rafter of the
main roof, using the blade
of <i>A</i> as a reference edge.
Blade of <i>B</i> gives the cut.</p>

<p><b>47. Framing a Roof
of Uneven Pitch.</b>—Not
infrequently a roof must
be framed in which several
pitches are involved. All
of the principles necessary
for framing such a roof
have been developed. It
remains for the student to make the applications to uneven
pitches. It is advisable to prepare a framing plan as shown
in <a href="#fig_87">Fig. 87.</a> From such a plan it may be seen that the seat and
plumb cuts of common and jack rafters are determined in the usual
manner, being different upon the different pitches, of course, but
determined as for any given pitch. Lengths of common rafters
will be determined for any pitch by the tables already made use of,
the run being known or determined.</p>

<p>In selecting the numbers to use on the tongue and the blade of
the square, in laying out seat and plumb cuts of hip or valley rafters
of intersecting roofs of different pitches, any numbers may be used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">-91-</span>
providing they have a ratio equal to that of the run and rise of the
rafter being framed. Since the angle of intersection changes with
every change of pitch, it is hardly worth while developing a constant
to be used on the tongue in framing hip and valley rafters on
irregular pitches.</p>

<p>Side or cheek cuts for valley, hip or jacks are determined
according to principles developed in <a href="#sec_35">Sec. 35</a>.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp98" id="fig_87" style="max-width: 16.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 87. Plan of Uneven Pitches</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The backing of hips on roofs of uneven pitches, while the
amount to be removed on each
side of the hip will vary, is
determined by the principles
developed in <a href="#sec_39">Sec. 39</a>. The
amount to be removed from
each side must be separately
determined according to the
angle the hip makes with the
plate.</p>

<p>Lengths of hip and valley
jacks are determined as in <a href="#sec_42">Sec. 42</a>. Lengths of cripple
jacks will not be of uniform length, as in even pitched roofs.
The runs for such jacks may be obtained with sufficient
accuracy by measurements taken from an accurately made scale
drawing.</p>

<p>The following example will make clear the method of attack
where it is desired to develop a constant for hip or valley in
terms of the common rafter of one of the pitches.</p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Example:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;Given: Main roof, Rise = 8', Run = 12' = ½pitch.<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Minor roof, Rise = 5', Run = 6' = 5/12 pitch.<br>
</div>

<p>(1) Find the run of valley rafter over <i>c</i>, <a href="#fig_88-a">Fig. 88-a</a>, in terms of
the run of the common rafter over <i>b</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">-92-</span></p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Solution:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;<i>c²</i> = <i>a²</i> + <i>b²</i> = (7½)² + 6² (<i>a</i>:12::5:8,<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;whence <i>a</i> = 7½)<br>
  &#160;&#160;<i>c</i> = 9.60'<br>
  &#160;&#160;Expressing this run of valley in terms of 12" of run of common rafter<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;over <i>b</i>.<br>
  &#160;&#160;9.60':6'::<i>x</i>:12".<br>
  &#160;&#160;<i>x</i> = 19.20". (Check this value by scale drawing.)
</div>

<p>Length of valley rafter, then, is found by taking 19.20" on the
tongue with 10" (5/6 of 12") on the blade, advancing the setting as
many times as there
are feet in the run of
the common rafter
over <i>b</i>.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp84" id="fig_88-a" style="max-width: 21.3125em;">
  <img src="images/fig_88-a.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 88-a. Uneven Pitches</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The numbers
just given will give
the plumb cut and
the seat cut of this
valley rafter.</p>

<p>(2) Find the side
cut of the valley
rafter when it rests
against the ridge of
the minor roof.</p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Solution:</i> The side cut of the valley when allowed to rest in the plane of the<br>
  &#160;&#160;plate = angle <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_88-a">Fig. 88-a</a>, whose tangent =<br>
  &#160;&#160;<i>b</i>/<i>a</i> =  6/7½ (= 12/15 = .800 = 38° 40')
</div>

<p>Therefore, take 7½" on the blade (always the run of intercepted
common rafter of major roof), and 6" on the tongue (always the
run of the common rafter of the minor roof); scribe on the blade.</p>

<p>For side cut of valley rafter when it is to be fitted to a ridge of
the major roof, the lay-out when in the plane of the plate is obtained
by means of these same numbers, but the scribing is done
on the tongue. This lay-out in either case is for the rafter when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">-93-</span>
lying in the plane of the plate. Having secured this, proceed as in
<a href="#sec_35">Sec. 35</a>, (2).</p>

<p>Side cuts of jacks for the minor roof are determined by the
length of the ridge over <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig_88-a">Fig. 88-a</a>, and the length of the rafter
over <i>b</i>. But the length of the ridge over <i>a</i>= the run of the intercepted
common rafter of the major roof, 7%' here. A general rule
may be derived, therefore: For the side cut of a jack on a minor
roof take on the blade of the square the run of the intercepted
common rafter of the major roof (inches for feet), and on the tongue
take the length of rafter of the minor roof; scribe on the tongue,
<a href="#fig_88-b-c">Fig. 88-b</a>. For the side cut of jacks on a major roof, take on the
tongue of the square the run of the common rafter of the minor
roof, and on the blade the length of the intercepted common rafter
of the major roof; scribe on the blade, <a href="#fig_88-b-c">Fig. 88-c</a>.</p>

<p>A new problem arises in connection with uneven or irregular
pitches, the problem of making the projecting cornice member one
with another. Manifestly, if one part of a roof is steeper than
another and the plate the same height all around the building, the
cornice cannot be made to meet in the same plane. This difficulty
is overcome by raising the plate of the steeper roof an amount equal
to the difference in the rises of the two pitches for a run equal to
that of the projecting cornice. For example, in a half-pitch the
rise would be 24" for a run of 24" in the cornice. In a quarter-pitch
rise for a 24" run of cornice would be 12", a difference in rises
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">-94-</span>
of 12". The plate of the steeper roof must be raised that much
higher than that for the lower pitch.</p>

</figure>

<p><b>48. Decks; Chimney Openings.</b>—Decks are sometimes used
in roof framing to prevent some part of the roof from rising too high
above the remainder. Such
decks are framed of joist
stock spiked together with
butt joints. Upon the top
of such deck joists are
placed feathering strips so
sawed as to give the deck a
slight "fall" in each direction,
two to three inches in
eight to ten feet. Upon
these feathering strips
flooring is laid.</p>

<p>The deck is framed, raised and braced, being held up by
studding placed under each corner. Next, the hip rafters are
placed, then the flooring on the deck, and finally the common
and jack rafters. Should common rafters be placed before the
deck flooring, the joists must be braced to withstand the pressure
against their sides. On large decks the outer deck frame is
doubled.</p>

<p>Chimney openings are framed as shown in <a href="#fig_89">Fig. 89.</a></p>

<p id="sec_49"><b>49. Sheathing or Sheeting.</b>—After the frame work of a
building is erected and the openings made in the frame for windows
and doors, the sheeting is to be placed. Sheeting is placed either
horizontally across the studs or
diagonally, sometimes both ways,
depending upon the specifications of
the architect. The diagonal is somewhat
stronger but is more expensive.
The horizontal is satisfactory upon
ordinary frame dwellings, especially
where the building is braced at the
corners by studs cut in diagonally,
or by sheeting placed diagonally at
the corners as in <a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90.</a> Such
sheeting should be matched and well
nailed with two 8d nails to each
stud. Building paper should be
placed upon the sheeting to further
protect the interior from cold.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 91. Setting T-bevel
for Roof Boards</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In making the face cut on roof boards for hips or valleys the
framing tool or the T-bevel may be made use of, being set to
the complement of the angle used in making the side or cheek cut
on jack rafters. The complement angle in this case equals 90
less the angle of the side cut of jack. Or, if the framing square is
to be used, the same numbers used in
making the side cut of the jack will be
used in laying out the face cut of roof
boards, with the scribing being done
along the tongue instead of along the
blade as in the case of the side cut.</p>

<p>A second T-bevel may be set as in
<a href="#fig_91">Fig. 91</a>, the beam being placed across
the edge of the jack and at right
angles to it, with the blade adjusted
to the cheek or sawed surface of the
jack which is to fit against hip or valley
rafter. A framing tool might be used.</p>

<p>Carpenters more frequently, however, get the angles for sawing
roof boards by laying the board
to be cut out over the hip or
valley rafter, then sawing along
the side the rafter as in <a href="#fig_92">Fig. 92.</a></p>

<p>In warm climates, weather
boarding is often applied directly
to the studs, no sheeting being
used; the frame being strongly
braced at the corners.</p>

<p><b>50. Scaffolding.</b>—Cornice is
placed after sheeting. To do this
advantageously it is necessary
to erect scaffolding or staging.
<a href="#fig_93">Fig. 93</a> illustrates a common
type. Stock 2" × 4" is used for the uprights, and 1" × 6" for the
horizontal members and braces or stays. Planks are placed upon
these horizontals as shown. <a href="#fig_94">Fig. 94</a> illustrates a substitute for
staging, a scaffold bracket upon which planks are laid.</p>

found constructed in almost endless variety of forms. The illustrations
shown will serve the purposes of this text. The student
should familiarize himself with the various common forms, details
of which may be got from any good, modern book on building
details.</p>

be available for mouldings. The old type of wood miter box, with
the various necessary cuts laid out in its sides is satisfactory.
Some experimenting will be necessary upon the part of the beginner
to determine the manner of placing the moulding in the box to give
the correct cut.</p>

<p>The cuts for the plancher, which rests in the planes of a hipped
roof and which must be membered around a corner are determined
in a manner similar to that described for roof boards, <a href="#sec_49">Sec. 49</a>, from

ends of the rafters.</p>

<p>Metallic gutters made to assume the form of the crown mould,
no wood crown mould being used, will be found in common use

<p><b>52. Raked Mouldings.</b>—In all cases
where a moulding resting in one plane,
as crown or bed moulding at the eaves,
is to be membered with moulding swung
up out of that plane, as up a gable, one
of two things must be done to make the
surfaces of the mouldings match or member
properly at the joint: (1) The moulding
at the eave may have its top edge
tipped forward until its top edge lies in
the same plane as the top edge of the
corresponding gable moulding; (2) a moulding with a new face
may be worked which will member with the eaves moulding
when their reverse surfaces are fitted to the fascia or, in case of
bed moulding, to the frieze.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp67" id="fig_98" style="max-width: 11.625em;">
  <img src="images/fig_98.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 98. Laying out Gable or Raked Moulding</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To member by means of the second method proceed as follows:
(1) Make a full sized drawing of a cross-section of the moulding,
<a href="#fig_98">Fig. 98.</a> (2) Draw a number of lines thru the more important reference
points of the moulding at an angle equal to the pitch of the
gable. (3) Draw horizontal lines thru the points of reference and
erect a perpendicular thru these passing thru the back of the
mould as <i>A-B</i>. (4) Lay off a line <i>C-D</i>, <a href="#fig_98">Fig. 98</a>, perpendicular to
the oblique lines. (5) Using the lines <i>A-B</i> and <i>C-D</i> as reference
lines, transfer the distances of the various points on the eaves
moulding, measured horizontally from <i>A-B</i>, to pitch lines measured
obliquely. A curve traced thru these points will give the
shape of the moulding required for the gable. Since this moulding
would, in all probability, have to be worked up especially for any
particular job, this practice is not followed except upon large or
important work. Cornices are usually designed so as to avoid
such work.</p>

</figure>

<p>Figs. <a href="#fig_99">99</a> and <a href="#fig_100">100</a> illustrate two miter-boxes constructed for use
in cutting rake mouldings in gables.</p>

<p>In making the miter cuts on mouldings of the eaves, the horizontal
members, no special box is needed. The moulding will be set
on the far side of the box, upside down. The box will have the side
cuts perpendicular to the top edge and the angles across the top edges
will be determined by the miter of the plate, sill, or corner of the
building. On a square cornered building this miter will be one of
45, 12" and 12" being taken on the square. Two cuts of each kind,
but reversed, are made in each box so that the moulding for each
side of each gable may be readily cut. On the octagonal building
5" and 12" would be used in laying out the miter, with scribing
done along the 5" member of the square.</p>

<p>For the miter cuts of the rake or gable member, special boxes
would best be constructed. For the cut of the gable member
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">-102-</span>
where it joins the eave moulding: (1) Lay off across the top of the
miter-box, right and left, the miter of the plate, sill, or corner of
the building. (2) Down the sides of the box lay off the slanting
lines as shown in <a href="#fig_99">Fig. 99</a>, at angles determined by the plumb cut of
the common rafter. (3) Lay the moulding in the box as indicated
by the cross-section, <a href="#fig_99">Fig. 99</a>, being careful to keep the backs of the
mouldings adjusted to the side and bottom of the box. A good
plan is to drive a nail or two in the bottom
of the box against which the moulding
may be made to rest, once the proper
position is determined by trial.</p>

<p>For the plumb cut of the gable moulding,
(1) lay off lines across the edges of
the box as in <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>, using on the framing
square the numbers which give the
plumb cut of the common rafter. Lay off
a right and a left cut as shown. (2)
Square these lines down the sides of the
box and saw. (3) The moulding will be
placed in the box as shown in the cross-section view of <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>,
especial care being taken to have the backs of the mouldings adjusted
to the back of the box.</p>

<p>Manifestly, one box may contain all these cuts to advantage
instead of having three boxes.</p>

<p>These cuts, Figs. <a href="#fig_99">99</a> and <a href="#fig_100">100</a>, serve in cutting the miters on ends
of the gable fascia. A little consideration will make clear the
remaining cuts upon ordinary cornice work.</p>

<p>In splicing mouldings, corner boards, etc., a mitered joint is
best and should be made so as to shed water from the joint,
<a href="#fig_101">Fig. 101.</a></p>

<p><b>53. Shingling.</b>—The reason for placing cornice before base or
window frames, etc., is to allow the workmen to work inside should
inclement weather overtake building operations at any time.
Shingling, therefore, will follow cornice work.</p>

<p>The amount of shingle to be exposed to the weather will depend
in general upon the pitch of the roof. In no case should
this exposure exceed 5 inches. The shingle most used is 16 inches
long, and each shingle should lap two courses beneath it. The
usual amount of lay is from 4" to 4%", by quarters. When
nearing the ridge or comb of a roof in shingling, the dimensions
used on the main body of the roof should be increased or decreased
so as to make the final layer show under the comb or
ridge or saddle boards properly. The worker should begin such
calculations when within about four or five feet of the ridge so
that changes of exposure of the different layers may not be noticeable
and so that the line of shingle butts may be kept parallel
with the ridge.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 102. Beginning Course</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first layer of shingles should be a double one with joints
properly broken, and with the butts projecting over the crown
moulding about 1½" to 2". Lay the shingles at the gables first,
then at intervals of about ten feet. Stretch a chalk line between
these fastening it to the butts by shingle nails driven into the butts,
<a href="#fig_102">Fig. 102.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">-104-</span></p>

<p>The remaining courses may be laid by means of a straight-edge
or by means of a chalk line. Both practices have ardent advocates.
Where a straight-edge is used, it is usually a piece of lap siding or
clapboard, and is held in place by being lightly tacked.</p>

</figure>

<p>In using the chalk line a man for each end is required. The
line is chalked and snapped for three courses at a time. The mechanic,
after a little practice, is able to keep the butts of the
shingles straight and to sight them so that they shall follow the
chalk line mark. On long courses a third person may be utilized in
chalking and in laying shingles. In chalking, this person holds
the line to the roof as sighted by an end man and the snapping is
done on each half of the line.</p>

<p>The chalking of a line so as to conserve the chalk is one of the
tricks of the trade which must be mastered early. It consists in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">-105-</span>
rotating the chalk about its hemispherical axis while being worked
backward and forward along the line, the line being held between
the chalk and the ball of the thumb. Otherwise the line would
soon sever the chalk.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 104. Shingling. Toe Holds</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cut nails should be used in preference to wire nails because of
their greater rust-resisting quality. Dry shingles should not be
laid tight together, ⅛ inch between is not unusual with dry shingles.
It is best to split shingles over 10 inches wide before laying them.
Each shingle should have at least two nails, the average is two
nails for every four to six inches of shingle.</p>

<p>Scaffolding for roof work, or toe hold, is usually constructed by
nailing shingles to 2" × 4" as shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_103">103</a> and <a href="#fig_104">104</a>. Other
forms are equally common. Apparently the holes left by the nails
used to fasten the toe hold to the roof would cause a leak in the
roof. To avoid any such danger, tho such danger is slight because
of the swelling of the wood fiber upon the application of moisture,
the shingles having such holes are driven down the roof slightly
by striking their surfaces a glancing stroke.</p>

<p><b>54. Shingling Hips and Valleys; Flashing; Saddle or Comb
Boards.</b>—Hip and valley shingles are usually sawed to shape before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">-106-</span>
being taken to the roof, the face cut being the same as that used
across the face of the roof boards and plancher members intersecting
about a corner of a hipped roof where plancher lies in the
plane of the roof. The cut across the edge of such shingles is made
square to the face.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_105-106" style="max-width: 31.0625em;">
  <img src="images/fig_105-106.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 105. Shingle Tins     Fig. 106. Valley</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of the many ways of protecting the intersection of hip shingles
when in place upon a roof, the simplest is that of employing tin
shingles. Such shingles should be of sufficient length to allow the
corners to be turned under as shown in <a href="#fig_105-106">Fig. 105</a>, and still extend
far enough under the next course of shingles to permit the nails
holding the tins to be covered. It is not good practice to nail
thru these tins after the roof has been covered, that is, to place
these tins after the roof has been shingled because the action of
the weather "lifts" the nails when exposed thus.</p>

<p>Valleys are covered with a strip of metal to a width of 20 inches.
Upon steep roofs and short valleys this width may be reduced to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">-107-</span>
16 inches. Space must be left between the edges of valley shingles
as shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_105-106">106</a> and <a href="#fig_107">107</a>. The amount will depend upon the
length of the valley and the steepness of the roof. For a ½ pitch
with a length of twelve to fourteen feet of valley, the space at the
top of the valley may well be 1 inch to each side of the valley center
line, widening gradually toward the lower end to 2½ inches to
each side. Chalk lines snapped upon the tin or other metal forming
the valley indicate the location of shingle edges. Nails in valley
shingles should be kept well back from the valley edge of the
shingles.</p>

<p>Flashing consists in placing tin shingles or other material about
the members making up a joint so that the joint shall "turn
water." Counterflashing consists in placing a double layer of tins
in such a way as to doubly insure turning water from a joint.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_108-109">Fig. 108</a> is an illustration of flashing where shingles meet lap
siding. Shingle tins are forced under the siding on one side and
either under or over the shingles, several inches of lap being allowed
all about.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_108-109">Fig. 109</a> illustrates a counterflashed chimney. A layer of tins
is placed as in flashing against siding except their top edges are not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">-108-</span>
inserted. Over these tins a second layer is placed as shown, the top
edges being inserted ¾" between the layers of brick, the mortar being
raked out so that this can be done. These turned edges are held in
place by the insertion of a wedging nail or tack, after which the cracks
are filled with cement, or better, an elastic roofing composition.</p>

<p>Tins should be carried high enough to prevent drifted snow from
entering; 2½ or 3 inches at the narrowest place.</p>

<p>Saddle or comb boards are of various forms. They are used
to give the ridge a finished appearance and to turn any water which
might happen to strike thereon; also to hold the last course of
shingles in place. A simple form is obtained by creasing to the
appropriate angle a strip of tin eight inches in width. Place this
on the ridge and nail its edges at intervals of 3 or 4 inches. Where
boards are used, one board should overlap the other and extend a
half inch beyond to turn water from the joint so made. Galvanized
ridge rolls may be purchased in stock styles.</p>

<p>A belt course is sometimes used between the first and second
stories of a building. Such a course is often constructed like the
water table. Like the water table or base, this belt course is furred
out in order to throw the course into greater relief. In case this
furring is not done, the lower edge of the belt board must be
rabbeted to receive the top edge of the siding. Frieze boards, too,
are frequently furred instead of being rabbeted. More elaborate
belt courses are common.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 111. Leveling Door Sill</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Building paper should be
stripped about the openings
for doors and windows before
the frames are set, to insure
warmth; also about corner
boards and cornice.</p>

<p>Corner boards and casing
edges should be very slightly
beveled so that the siding
may take a slight squeeze as
it is placed. Care in setting
frames and in making casing edges true will insure a saving of
time in placing siding.</p>

<p><b>56. Setting Window and Door Frames.</b>—Two men usually
work together in setting frames, as in fact they do on much other
carpentry work. In setting door frames on outer walls (1) the
rough floor, etc., must be cut away so that the top of the sill may
rest on a level with finished floor when that is in place. (2) When
this is done the door sill is carefully leveled, <a href="#fig_111">Fig. 111</a>, and shingle
points inserted under the sill where needed to give solidity and
support. (3) The casing is given a nail close to the sill at each side
of the frame and (4) the sides of the jambs, are plumbed and the
casings finish nailed. If the work is carefully done the frame
should be square.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">-111-</span></p>

<p>Where heads of several windows are a given distance from the
floor, a stiff stick may be cut this length and used in placing windows
in position for height. The window sills will be leveled as
are door sills; the jambs are plumbed, <a href="#fig_112-113">Fig. 112</a>, and casings nailed
at intervals of about a foot.</p>

<p><b>57. Siding.</b> Preparatory to siding, a siding stick should
be made. Such a stick is made by planing parallel edges upon a
piece of Y% inch stock about 1 inch in width. Upon this stick marks
will be made which will indicate the spacing of the siding; these
marks being transferred to corner boards and casing edges, <a href="#fig_112-113">Fig.
113</a>. To lay off this stick a given space is taken, water table drip
cap to the lower edge of a window sill for example. (1) This space
may be transcribed upon the stick easiest by setting the stick upon
the drip cap and against the casing edge, marking under the sill
upon the stick. (2) This space is "stepped off" by means of a
pair of dividers set to the amount of exposure desired. Exposures
will run from 4¼ to 4¾ inches on ordinary lap or bevel siding.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">-112-</span>
(3) Should there be a remainder, and there almost always is, the
exposure must be increased or decreased, whichever is necessary,
an amount sufficient to give an equal or even number of divisions.
In practice this amount is found by stepping off as suggested and
then making necessary adjustments by guess and again stepping.
This is continued until the desired result is attained. The difference
is thus divided equally over the whole space instead of over
the last courses as in shingling.</p>

</table>

<p>In a similar manner a stick, or
another space of the same stick is laid off and stepped for the space
between the bottom of the window sill and the top of the drip cap
above the head casing of the window, etc. On long lateral spaces
this stick will be used to keep the lower edges of the boards in
position between the casings, by transferring its marks to the
building paper, stepping down from one of these marks with a pair
of dividers to the lower edge of the siding board being placed. (4) A
bunch of siding boards should have one end of each sawed square
across the face, but sawed under on the back side slightly so as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">-113-</span>
insure a fit on the surface. (5) One end is next fitted, with block
plane if necessary, after which (6) the length is marked by turning
the board upside down and marking on the lower edge of the board,
which is uppermost, with a knife, <a href="#fig_114-115">Fig. 114.</a> Another way to mark
length is indicated in <a href="#fig_114-115">Fig. 115.</a> This tool is called a siding hook or
tool and this method possesses
the advantage of caring for any
lack of squareness in the frame
or trim.</p>

<p>In nailing, care must be
taken to place the nail so that
it shall pass thru both boards
where lapped. Under windows
it will be necessary to trim off
part of the upper edges of the
siding boards. Saw kerfs at
either side of the part to be cut,
and a sharp, deep knife scoring
along a straight-edge should be
used to outline the part to be
removed. To determine the
amount to be removed, set the
dividers to the amount of spacing used for the boards in the space
under the window, plus the depth of rabbet, or groove in the
under side of the window sill into which the upper edge of the
siding board must fit. Set off this amount on the siding board
from the butt or under edge at each end of proposed cut, and
connect with straight-edge; scoring with knife.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 116. Siding Circular Tower</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Occasionally the carpenter is called upon to side a circular tower
or rounded corner of a building. That the lower edge of each
board may rest in a horizontal plane it will be necessary to shape
that edge before applying the board to the side of the building. To
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">-114-</span>
determine the amount of curvature to give such an edge proceed as
follows: (1) Plot a curve to represent the plan of the tower, <a href="#fig_116">Fig. 116.</a>
Draw this upon a scale sufficiently large and make use of
accuracy such as will insure a result equal to the requirements of
the occasion. (2) Draw the line <i>A-B</i> of indefinite length. (3)
Place a section of a clapboard in the position it will have on the
sheeting, as at <i>abc</i>, <a href="#fig_116">Fig. 116</a>, and (4) extend a line along the face
surface to meet <i>A-B</i>. (5) With a radius equal to <i>B-C</i> describe
an arc with <i>B</i> as a center which shall cut the siding board as shown,
taking an equal amount off the edge at each end.</p>

<p>Occasionally it becomes necessary to fit a casing against a sided
wall. This casing is scribed as indicated in <a href="#fig_117">Fig. 117</a>, a pair of sharp
dividers being made to follow the contour of the wall with one point
while the other marks or scribes the casing. A saw will be used to
cut to these lines, sawing under slightly to insure a fit at the face.</p>

<p><b>58. Lathing; Grounds.</b>—Lathing is usually considered a part
of the plasterer's work but the carpenter is expected to prepare
the grounds and place the necessary furrings. The success of
the plasterer depends in no small degree upon the way the carpenter
does this work. If
corners are not firmly constructed,
cracks will be sure
to appear in the plastering.</p>

<p>In lathing, joints must be
broken upon different studding
every dozen lath, and
joints are not to be allowed
about a door or window opening
where their presence
would weaken the wall; such
as short lath nailed at one end
only. Neither are lath to be
placed at right angles to the
usual run of lath on the wall because uneven shrinkage would
cause the plaster to crack.</p>

<p>That the plasterer may make walls true and of uniform thickness
about door and window openings and along the floor, grounds
are placed as in <a href="#fig_118">Fig. 118.</a> Such grounds are of stock if 13/16" × 1" or 2"
nailed firmly to the studding. Grounds for base should be placed
so that the wall may be lathed and plastered entirely to the floor
that cold and vermin may be kept out.</p>

<p>For grounds on external corners in a room, metallic corners
especially manufactured for this purpose are recommended.</p>

<p>The beginner will be surprised at the numberless places requiring
attention in preparing for the plasterer. He should visualize
every corner and angle as he thinks the plasterer or lather must
have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">-117-</span></p>

<p><b>59. Interior Walls.</b>—<a href="#fig_119">Fig. 119</a> illustrates the construction of a
corner of an interior wall which is to be recommended highly for
strength. All door studding are to be doubled for strength, also
window openings of unusual size.</p>

<p>Interior door jambs are not usually placed until after plastering
has been done. Thresholds are no longer used with interior
openings where both rooms are to be heated.</p>

<p>Joists doubled to support partitions should be spread sufficiently
to allow furnace pipes to enter, and still provide bearing for
partition studs.</p>

<p>Badly crooked studs in a partition wall may be straightened by
sawing a kerf on the hollow side, almost thru, and wedging with a
shingle point. A cleat nailed to the side of the stud after wedging
will give the original strength. Straight studs should be selected
for use about openings.</p>

<p>In setting studs for interior door jambs where studs are to be
doubled on the inside, add to the width of door enough to make
the outer edges of the casings center on studs, and double inside
these, as in figuring openings between studs for outside door jambs.
Make allowance for the extra thickness of stud on each side. For
height of opening, where no threshold is to be used, add 2½" to the
height of the door. Remember that enough more must be cut
from vertical studs to allow for thickness of header.</p>

<p><b>60. Stair Building; Porch Steps.</b>—Stair building is an art in
itself and as such belongs to millwork rather than to carpentry.
However, the carpenter must know the principles of simple stair
lay-out and construction for he is called upon to construct porch
steps, basement and often attic stairs. In smaller communities
he may also have to build the main stair. <a href="#fig_120">Fig. 120</a> illustrates three
common types of stair.</p>

<p>In planning a stair, the first requisite is to know its rise and run,
<a href="#fig_121">Fig. 121.</a> The rise in this case is the vertical distance measured
from the top of the first floor to the top of the second floor. The
run is the horizontal span of the stair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">-118-</span></p>

  <img src="images/fig_121.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 121. Rise and Run of Stair</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A good average stair for a cottage will have a rise per step of 7
inches and a run of tread of 10 inches. Variations will have to be
made in both rise and tread to meet conditions, but the student
may take these dimensions as starting dimensions unless otherwise
directed. Steps should not be either too steep, due to excessive rise
per foot, or "slow" due to extreme width of step. An old rule for
determining the relation of rise to tread is: "Twice the rise plus the
tread should equal 24"."</p>

<p>Proceed as follows: (1) Lay off on a story pole the total rise
of the stair by placing the pole upright in the well hole. (2) Set
a pair of dividers to 1" and step off this distance so marked. If
there is a remainder, increase or diminish the divider's space and
again step off the space. Continue this until a setting is obtained
which gives no remainder. The number of risers will be found by
counting the spaces, and the rise per step by measuring one of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">-120-</span>
spaces. (3) If the run of the stair is not of exact specification
(some variation is usually possible) the run per step or tread may be
determined by the rule just given. If a definite total run is specified
the tread must be figured. (4) Since there is always one more
riser than tread, the run
per step is obtained by
dividing the total run in
inches by the number of
risers less one. The
numbers thus obtained
for rise and run per step
are the ones to be used on the framing square in laying out the
stringers.</p>

<p>(5) Joint one edge of each stringer straight and square and
place the framing square as in <a href="#fig_122">Fig. 122</a> and scribe along both blade
and tongue. (6) Scribe the line <i>A</i> parallel to the 9" run, at a
distance from it equal to the rise diminished by the thickness of the
proposed tread. (7) Continue to lay the square as in (5) until the
required number of steps have been laid out. A pitch board might
have been constructed and made use of instead of the framing
square in laying out the stringers. This is nothing more than a
piece of stock which serves as a template by which to lay out the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">-121-</span>
rise and run of each step, <a href="#fig_123">Fig. 123.</a> A cleat or fence nailed to one
edge after the three edges have been planed to dimensions permits
easy and accurate placing of the same.</p>

<p>(8) There remains the sawing out. On open stringers this is
done by sawing square across the board or plank. Where the
exposed ends of risers would make a bad appearance, the cuts in
the stringers for risers are made
mitering and the ends of the
risers are mitered correspondingly. In either case the end
of the riser will be flush with
the exposed side of the stringer
or string.</p>

<p><b>61. Risers and Treads.</b>—Upon the common stair, such as
attic and porch, etc., treads and risers are placed as in <a href="#fig_120">Fig. 120</a>,
being nailed to place, risers first and then treads.</p>

<p>On porch steps and open stringers, the treads should overhang
at their ends an amount equal to that given the front. The cove,
if one be used, should be carried around and "returned" under the
end of the tread.</p>

<p>On enclosed or semi-enclosed stringers, a combination of
stringer and wall board is commonly used. <a href="#fig_125">Fig. 125</a> illustrates a
type of construction often used upon attic stairs. In this the side
stringers are framed of 1" stock and then nailed to the wall board
of similar thickness. Such construction is not suited for first
floor stair work where the effects of shrinkage would show to
greater disadvantage.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_126">Fig. 126</a> illustrates the manner of framing a modern stair suitable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">-122-</span>
for a first floor where the best type of construction is demanded.
As a rule, such stair work will be done at a mill and the stair
brought to the building knock-down. The carpenter will have
framed the rough stringers which are to support the ceiling below
the stair, and placed them so that they may be used as a temporary
stair for the workmen. If the stairway is an open one or semi-open,
the plastering under these stringers will have been placed,
the stair being put together on the floor and then raised to its place.
If the well-hole is such that the stair must be assembled while the
strings or wall boards are in place, the lath and plaster must be
left off the rough stringers until after the stair has been assembled
and the wedges glued and driven in place as shown in the illustration.
Rough stringers must be placed far enough from the sides
of the well-hole so that the wall board may settle in place and that
the wedges may be easily placed, usually about 4" or 5" from the
wall will be sufficient.</p>

<p><b>62. Porches.</b>—<a href="#fig_127">Fig. 127</a> illustrates the manner of framing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">-123-</span>
the floor of a porch. Such framework should be given a pitch
downward away from the house of about 1" in 10' that the water
may be drained.</p>

and the whole furred out from the frame about a quarter of an
inch to allow any dampness to escape. Porch floors should have
their joints painted with lead just before being laid.</p>

</figure>

<p>Posts and balusters are usually placed after the porch roof has
been placed, the upper frame being temporarily supported by studs.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig_127">Fig. 127</a> is also shown the manner of framing the bearing
joists, ceiling joists and rafters for a hip roof. The various cuts
are obtained in the same manner as are similar cuts on the main
roof. Porch roofs are seldom given as much pitch as the main
roof. They do not need as much and must, usually, be kept below
the window sill line of the second story.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_128">Fig. 128</a> also illustrates a common type of trim for porch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">-125-</span>
cornice. Where supporting plates are long, a flitch plate girder
is formed of them by the insertion between them of a stiff plate of
structural steel of suitable length and width.</p>

<p><b>63. Interior Finish.</b>—A part of the carpenter's duty is the
placing of all interior finish, such as base boards, door jambs, etc.
Formerly the carpenter made, or "got out" his trim by hand but
today he finds it much pleasanter and cheaper to buy the machine-made
product of the mill. Even door and window frames are
usually purchased from the mill, either assembled or knock-down.</p>

<p><b>64. Setting Door Jambs.</b>—If the studs about interior door
openings have been carefully selected for straightness and properly
set or plumbed, the setting of the door jamb should be an easy
matter, If this work has not been properly done, considerable
ingenuity will be required oftentimes to get the frame set so that
its edges are out of wind and the frame plumb. If a jamb should
not be set plumb and out of wind, the operation of making a door
fit its stops properly is a most trying one and the result usually
unsatisfactory. Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the
necessity for proper placing of studs and jambs. (1) Saw off the
head lugs just enough to allow the frame to be placed in the opening.
(2) Cut a spacing stick of a length sufficient to reach from the
floor to the under surface of the head jamb when that member is
in its proper place. (3) Place the head jamb at one of its ends upon
this stick and tack the jamb to the stud lightly. (4) Level the
head jamb and lightly tack the second jamb, inserting wedging
blocks or shingle points between the jamb and stud. A spread
stick cut to hold the jambs apart properly at the base is desirable.
(5) Lay a piece of finish floor against the face of each jamb and
scribe along the top of this to indicate where the jambs must be
cut off to fit the finish floor when it is placed. It is taken for
granted that the finish floor is to be laid last. If a finish floor is
not to be used, or if it is to be placed before the wall trim, the head
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">-126-</span>
jamb will be leveled but not located as to height, the dividers being
used to scribe the feet, being set so that the proper amount will
be cut off to allow the jamb to rest at the right height when cut to
the scribed lines. (6) Remove the jamb and saw to the scribed
lines. (7) Replace the frame and tack it at one side after plumbing
it both on its face side and face edge. See that the jamb is at the
right height by inserting the blocks of flooring used in scribing to
length. (8) Tack the second side-jamb close to the head. (9) Sight
across the edges of these jambs and adjust the loose jamb until
the frame is out of wind. Plumb its face, blocking the back.
Shingles placed point to point provide easy blocking where the
space is not too large. A straight-edge placed against the face of a
jamb will indicate whether it has been sprung in the blocking or
wedging between jamb and stud.</p>

<p><b>65. Fitting Window Sash.</b>—Sash are often fitted before the
house is plastered and before the sash are glazed. (1) Joint the
top and sides of the top sash, chamfering the arrises very slightly
by a stroke or two with the plane. (2) Cut and fit the meeting
rails about the parting stops remembering to leave a little "play,"
that successive coats of paint on the stops may not cause binding,
1/16" on each side is not too much. (3) Joint the edges of the lower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">-127-</span>
sash. (4) Since the bottom rail has not been beveled, only the
lugs sawed off, the meeting rails will appear with reference to one
another as in <a href="#fig_129-130">Fig. 129.</a> Set a pair of dividers to a distance equal
to that between the tops of the meeting rails. This can be done by
placing the dividers between the meeting rails. (5) Scribe the
bottom rail as indicated in <a href="#fig_129-130">Fig. 130.</a> If the sash has been glazed
so that the outer face of the bottom rail is not accessible from the
inside, the scribing is to be done on the inside of the bottom rail and
a T-bevel set to the slope of the sill and this used to transfer the
angle to the edges of the sash. Before scribing the bottom rail,
see that the meeting rails are apart a uniform distance across the
sash. (6) Saw and then plane to the scribed line.</p>

<p>Where sash weights are to be used, they are easiest placed
before lathing. The proper tying of a sash cord so that it shall
not work loose with time is a matter for careful instruction by the
teacher. No good carpenter will have his sash cords coming
untied. The cord can be cut the estimated length after the
weight has been attached, and a knot or loop tied in the free end so
that the cord shall not slip thru the pulley.</p>

<p>In case weights are not placed before the lath and plaster, it will
be necessary to make use of a "duck" to draw the end of the sash
cord up thru the removed pocket cover of the jamb. This "duck"
is usually a piece of lead beaten about one end of a piece of stout
short cord. This lead weight is lowered thru the pulley by means
of a longer cord, the end of the sash cord is then fastened to the
longer cord, after removing the duck, and then drawn up and thru
the pulley.</p>

<p>To determine the length of sash cord, draw the sash weight to
the top of the jamb and, setting a sash upon the sill, mark and cut
the cord about four or five inches below the opening in the edge of
the sash in which the knotted end of the cord is to rest.</p>

<p><b>66. Placing Door, Window, and other Trim.</b>—In <a href="#fig_110">Fig. 110-a</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">-128-</span>
is shown one of the many styles of casing in common use. Base
blocks and casing stock are prepared at the mill and the carpenter
has but to cut these to the proper lengths and fit and attach them.
(1) The base block is first placed, tho some workmen prefer to fit
the base first, cutting it to a
length such as will allow the
proper placing of the block after
the base is nailed in position.
Where the finish floor is laid last,
this block will be scribed at its
bottom by means of a piece of
flooring, otherwise the dividers
would be used. (2) After the
blocks are placed the casings are
cut to length and nailed. (3) The
head member is next made up and
placed. It is customary for all
door and window heads, where
built up, to be constructed at one
time. It should be noted that
door casings are not placed flush
with the face of the jamb. They should be kept back about
5/16". This is to allow the easy placing of hinges and also for
appearance' sake. In all casing work the expedient of sawing
under at the back should be supplemented by the use of the block
plane, where necessary, that tight joints may result.</p>

<p>Window stool stock, like that of casings, is prepared at a mill
and needs only to be cut to length and have the ends "returned"
to match the face edge. (1) Lower the sash, then fit the stool
to this allowing enough "play" that subsequent paint or varnish
may not cause the stool to bind the lower rail of the sash. (2)
Place and nail the apron. (3) Cut and place the side casings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">-129-</span>
Note that side casings are placed flush with the face of the jambs.
The crack so formed is concealed when the stop bead is placed.
(4) Place the head.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 132. Door Parts</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Base boards and base mould may now be placed. Blocks of a
thickness of the finish floor placed along the
wall at frequent intervals will serve to locate
the position of the base above the rough floor,
when the finish floor is to be laid afterward.
Internal corners of base mould and picture
mould, when of irregular face, should be
coped. External corners should have mitered
joints. Shoe mould will be placed after the
finish floor is laid.</p>

<p>Stop beads may next be placed in the
windows and in such doors as are not rabbeted.
Head stops are placed first and the
side stops then coped to these. A block of
a width equal to the thickness of the door
will be an aid in placing stops easily, <a href="#fig_131">Fig. 131.</a>
Window stops should be so placed that the lower sash may move
freely as it is raised.</p>

<p><b>67. Hanging Doors.</b>—In the fitting of large doors, such as in
dwellings, allowance must be made for subsequent coats of varnish
or paint, usually a scant 1/16" is allowed at top and each side of a
door. The bottom of a door is often not touched, except to saw
away the lugs of the stiles, until after the door is hung. The door
is hinged, then closed and the bottom scribed to the floor so as to
allow the door to swing over rugs or carpet freely. Where a threshold
is to be used, the door is scribed to fit the thickness of the
proposed threshold. ⅛" should be allowed at the bottom of the
door for play. If a door has a stile with a bow in its face, it should
be turned so that the bow is next the stop of the lock side.</p>

<p><b>68. Fitting a Door.</b>—The names of the parts of a door and
their relative positions are indicated in <a href="#fig_132">Fig. 132.</a> (1) Mark with
a try-square and saw off the lugs, the parts of the stiles which project
beyond the rails. (2) Plane an edge of the door until it fits
the side of the frame against which it is to be hung. If the frame
is straight, this edge may be planed straight. It is not wise to take
for granted the squareness
or straightness of a
frame. A test or series
of tests may first be
made with square and
straight-edge. A mechanic,
however, usually
planes an edge until it
fits the frame, testing by
holding the door against
the frame as near to its
position as its size will
allow. (3) Measure the
width of the frame at its
top and bottom, <a href="#fig_133">Fig. 133</a>, and transfer these dimensions to the top
and bottom of the door, <a href="#fig_134">Fig. 134.</a> When approaching the line, in
planing, place the door against the frame often enough to see
where the allowances must be made for irregularities in the frame.
(4) Plane the top edge of the door until it fits the frame properly
when the first planed edge is in position. (5) The length of the
door will be determined by scribing it to the floor after being
hinged.</p>

<p>The edge of the door which is to swing free is usually planed
slightly lower at the back arris than at the front. An examination
of the movement of an ordinary house door will show the reason for
this.</p>

<p><b>69. Hinging a Door.</b>—The hinges most commonly used in
carpentry are the kind known as butts. Where the door stands in
a vertical position, hinges in which the two parts are joined by a
loose pin are generally used. By removing the pins the door may
be removed without taking the screws out of the hinge. Such
hinges are more easily applied than those with the fixed pin.
(1) Place the door in position; keep it tight against the top and the
hinge side of the frame. (2) Measure from top and bottom of the
door to locate the position
for the top of the
higher hinge and the
bottom of the lower
hinge. Usually, the
lower hinge is placed
somewhat farther from
the bottom than the
higher hinge is from the
top. (3) With the knife
or chisel mark on both door and frame at the points just located,
<a href="#fig_135">Fig. 135.</a> (4) Take out the door, place the hinge as in <a href="#fig_136">Fig. 136</a>,
and mark along the ends with a knife. In a similar manner mark
the frame. Make certain that the openings on door and on
frame are laid off so as to correspond before proceeding further,
(5) Set the gage for the depth the hinge is to be sunk <a href="#fig_137-138">Fig. 137</a>
and gage both door and frame. (6) Set another gage for width
of openings, <a href="#fig_137-138">Fig. 138</a>, and gage both door and frame, keeping
the head of the gage against the front of the door. (7) Chisel
out these gains on door and frame, <a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139.</a> (8) If loose-pin
butts are used, separate the parts and fasten them in place.
Use a spiral drill to make openings for the screws. To insure the
hinges' pulling tight against the side of the gain make the holes
just a little nearer the back side of the screw hole of the hinge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">-132-</span>
Put the door in place and insert the pins. It is a good mechanic
who can make a door hang properly the first time it is put up. It
is better, therefore, to insert but
one or two screws in each part of a
hinge until the door has been
tried. (9) If the door hangs away
from the frame on the hinge side,
take it off; take off hinge on door
or frame, or both if the crack is
large; chisel the gain deeper at its
front. By chiseling at the front
only and feathering the cut toward
the back, the gain needs to
be cut but about one-half as deep
as if the whole hinge were sunk.
If the door should fail to shut
because the hinge edge strikes the
frame to soon, the screws of the
offending hinge must be loosened
and a piece of heavy paper or cardboard
inserted along the entire edge
of the gain. Fasten the screws and
cut off the surplus paper with a
knife. If plain butt hinges are used
the operations are similar to those
just described except that the whole
hinge must be fastened to the door
and the door held in place while
fastening the hinges to the frame.</p>

<p><b>70. Fitting Locks.</b>—Two types
of lock are in common use upon dwelling doors, the rim and
the mortise lock. The rim lock, <a href="#fig_140">Fig. 140</a>, is used upon cheap
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">-133-</span>
construction and is attached to the outer surface of the door.
The mortise lock is used upon the better class of work; the box is
housed into a mortise and the selvage into a gain cut into the edge
of the door stile. Door locks are made so that the bolts may be
reversed to fit either right or left hand doors. This is accomplished
by removing a screw in the side of the box and carefully
lifting the bolt, replacing it in reversed position. A right hand
door is one which swings to the
right when pushed open.</p>

<p>To place a mortise lock, <a href="#fig_141">Fig. 141</a>: (1) In a manner similar
to that used in placing the rim lock, locate the knob spindle and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">-134-</span>
key holes. A more accurate result is obtained if the knob spindle
hole is located by four points, one at each corner of the square,
<a href="#fig_142">Fig. 142.</a> In placing the lock, keep the selvage back from the edge
of the door a scant 1/16" so that the selvage may be sunk below the
edge of the door by that
amount when mortised in.</p>

Bore the holes for knob

Locate a center line on
the edge of the stile and bore for the mortise which shall receive
the box of the lock. (4) Place the box and then mark about the
protruding selvage

the lock and
"gain in" the selvage,

Fasten the lock by
means of the screws
thru the selvage and
attach the escutcheons,
knob spindle

Close the door and
mark the vertical position of the latch upon the jamb. (8) Open
the door and place the latch or strike plate, locating its vertical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">-135-</span>
position by means of the knife marks just made upon the jamb,
and its horizontal position by a measurement taken from the latch
to the face of the door; transfer to the jamb by rule or gage. (9)
Scribe about the plate and then gain it into the jamb. On a
door with a rabbeted jamb instead of an adjustable stop, the
essential measurement will be
from the back arris of the stile
to the front of the latch. (10)
Attach the plate, then chisel out
the openings for latch and bolt.</p>

<p><b>71. Laying and Scraping
Floors.</b>—Quarter-sawed stock
makes the best wearing floor.
However, oak wears well in either
plain or quarter-sawed forms. All
hard wood finish floors are milled
with tongues and grooves on edges and ends. Holes for nailing
are usually drilled at the mill also.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 142. Locating Knob Spindle
Hole</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In laying a finish floor, it is not advisable to lay it with its
lengths extending in the same direction as those of the rough floor.
The shrinkage of the wide boards of the under floor will open
unseemly cracks in the finish floor. Where it is necessary to run
lengths for both floors in the same direction the finish floor should
be separated from the rough floor by thin furring, such as lath,
placed 16" apart. Rough floors laid diagonally overcome this
difficulty. Paper is usually placed between the two floors. Care
should be taken in starting a floor to select straight boards. Where
grooves fail to fit tongues of boards that are laid, a piece of 2" × 4"
about 3' or 4' long should be used as a pounding block that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">-136-</span>
tongue of the board being laid may not be battered, the most common
cause of trouble in floor laying. Nails are driven "toeing"
thru the board just above the tongue that the heads may be concealed
and also to better draw the board in position. Hammer
marks showing upon the face of a floor indicate carelessness. It is
not necessary that nails should always strike joists, for a good
rough floor will hold such nails with sufficient firmness. Where
nails must be driven into hard maple, a hole must be drilled first.
On the great majority of hard woods the dipping of the point of the
nail in soap or oil will cause it to enter the wood with careful driving,
without the drilling of a hole.</p>

<p>After a hardwood floor has been laid it should be scraped.
Scraping floors is a tedious task at best. Electrically driven machines
now relieve the carpenter of much of this work, the floors
being laid and finished by a specialist in floor work. The shoe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">-137-</span>
mould is placed last, being nailed to the floor, so that any shrinkage
of the joists will cause the mould to drop with the floor. Base
board and shoe mould should be stained, but not varnished, before
the mould is placed.</p>

<p>On account of waste in tonguing and grooving and straightening
flooring stock, an allowance
of from ⅕ to ¼
extra is necessary in
estimating.</p>

<p><b>72. Door and Window Frames.</b>—Like
other carpentry detail,
window and door frames
may be constructed in
any one of a number of
styles. <a href="#fig_145">Fig. 145</a> illustrates a satisfactory type
of door frame for cottage
use. The sill will be
given a pitch or fall of
1" in 12" and will have
its ends housed into the
jambs. The jambs will
be assembled first, being nailed together. Next, the side casings are
fitted at their lower ends, cut to length and nailed. Frequently
they are nailed and then cut to length. The head casing with its
cap is next placed.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_146">Fig. 146</a> illustrates a common type of cottage window frame.
The method of procedure is not unlike that described for the door
frame. The sill will be grooved on its under side to receive the
top edge of the siding board and given a fall of 1" in 10". Jambs
must be grooved to receive a parting stop as shown. Where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">-138-</span>
weights are to be used each jamb must have a pocket as detailed.
The stock sawed out of the jamb may be made use of for pocket
cover stock by proper manipulation. Pulleys may be placed before
the jambs are assembled, at least the holes for them should be
prepared.</p>

<p>There are a number of "tricks of the trade" in frame making.
Their presentation must
be left to the instructor,

belongs to millwork and
space can be spared here
for general directions

<p><b>73. Woodwork in
Masonry Structures.</b>—Wood framing in brick
and other masonry buildings
is but slightly different
from that wholly in
wood. <a href="#fig_147">Fig. 147</a> illustrates
the manner of framing
the ends of joists which
rest in solid masonry walls.
The ends are shaped as indicated so that, in case of fire, the floors
in falling will not pull over the walls, but will fall free. Anchors
are used to tie the building together, and these are to be placed
near the lower edge of the joists so that they may split out of the
joists easily or allow the floor to drop free, in case of a falling of
the floor and joists.</p>

<p>A popular type of construction is that known as brick veneer,
<a href="#fig_148">Fig. 148.</a> It consists of an ordinary framed house with a covering
of brick as shown. These bricks are fastened to the wall by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">-139-</span>
metallic bonds. From the outside, the building has all of the
appearance of solid brick, while it is claimed that a wall so formed
is warmer than one of solid brick.</p>

<p><b>74. Methods of Estimating.</b>—Building costs may be divided
into two main divisions, cost of material and cost of labor. There
is but one so-called safe way to figure or estimate the cost of any
particular piece of carpentry work. This consists in "taking off"
the material quantities in detail and to this adding the labor cost
of placing the same. This is the method in common use by contractors
in making a final estimate. Where a rough or working
estimate is required, such as an architect's estimate of the probable
cost of a building planned by him, two methods may be used.
One consists in figuring the cubical contents in feet and multiplying
a predetermined, or unit price per cubic foot for that
type of house. Ordinarily, the main frame is figured, counting
from the basement floor to the top of the attic walls that are, or
may be finished—outside measurements. Porches and open
spaces are not figured. A second method consists in estimating the
number of squares (100 sq. ft.) of side wall, of partitions, of floors,
etc., and multiplying a predetermined price per square for a
similar type of building. This latter method is more accurate than
the cubic-foot unit method.</p>

<p><b>75. Table for Estimating by Cubic-Foot Unit.</b>—The following
table of unit prices will give a rough working estimate for
various types of building differentiated after the custom of insurance
adjusters. The prices are for 1915 and to be of any value
must be compared with known costs of similar structures in the
community in which they are to be used. Any evident variations
in unit costs so discovered should be noted and corrections made.</p>

<p><b>76. Grading Rules.</b>—There is no uniformity as to grades of
lumber. Fifteen or more associations have rules for inspection. and
classification of lumber and these rules vary with the association
and from year to year in the same association. The following
rules taken from a catalogue of a middle west lumber concern will
be found helpful:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellow Pine Dimension, Studding, Joists and Timbers</span></p>

<p><i>No. 1 Common.</i>—The best grade and the one recommended for
use on first class jobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">-144-</span></p>

<p><i>No. 2 Common.</i>—Dimension up to 20 feet long only can be
obtained in this grade. Timbers are not manufactured in No. 2.
This stock will show defects not found in No. 1 grade, and
some pieces are not entirely straight. It is a sound, serviceable
grade, but not recommended for first class work.</p>

<p class="caption3 smcap">Yellow Pine Boards, Sheathing, Shiplap, and Fencing</p>

<p><i>No. 1 Common.</i>—This grade is not clear, but is strictly sound
and uniform in thickness and width. It is used on the best
classes of work, for barn boards, and wherever exposed to wear
and weather.</p>

<p><i>No. 2 Common.</i>—This grade is sound but contains more sound
knots than No. 1 and is somewhat coarser. It is mostly used
on first class jobs for sub or rough floors, and for sheathing under
siding. It can be used for outside work, but is not recommended
for this purpose except upon cheap buildings.
No. 8 Common. A fairly good lower grade which will work up
nicely but with some waste due to cutting out defects. Runs
uneven in quality. Makes a fair subfloor or sheathing.</p>

<p class="caption3 smcap">Yellow Pine Flooring, Ceiling, Partition, and Drop Siding</p>

<p><i>Clear Grade.</i>—The best grade manufactured. Practically free
from defects and the grade used upon first class jobs. Is strong,
sound, and will lay without waste due to cutting out of imperfections.
Should be used when a natural finish is desired.
No. 1 Common. This grade will contain small, sound knots,
sap stains, pitch or pitch pockets. It is sound and durable,
and a good grade for ordinary work or wherever covered with
paint.</p>

<p><i>No. 2 Common.</i> Coarser than No. 1 grade; will lay up with
little waste. Is sound, and flooring of this grade is often used
for sheathing or sub flooring where a warm, tight job is desired.
Can also be used on cheap painted jobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">-145-</span></p>

<p class="caption3 smcap">Fir Boards, Timbers, Drop Siding, Ceiling and Flooring</p>

<p><i>Select No. 1 Barn Boards.</i>—This grade is especially selected and
is better than No. 1.</p>

<p><i>No. 1 Timbers.</i>—Good sound straight stock, to be used for sills
and posts subjected to moisture.</p>

<p><i>Clear Ceiling.</i>—Free from defects. Good for cornice work and
porch ceilings.</p>

<p><i>Edge Grain Flooring, Clear Grade.</i>—Especially suited to porch
floors as it wears well and resists effects of moisture.</p>

<p><i>Clear Drop Siding.</i>—Contains no sap, shakes or other defects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shingles, Lap Siding, Y. P. and Cypress Finish,
White Pine Boards</span></p>

<p><i>5 to 2 Clears.</i>—The heaviest grade five shingles laid one on
top of the other will measure 2" at the butts.</p>

<p><i>6 to 2 Extra Star A Star.</i>—A lighter grade, but clear and 16", as
are the 5 to 2" grade.</p>

<p><i>Bevel or Lap Siding.</i>—Carried in stock in red cedar, redwood,
cypress, and white pine. "Clear" is free from all defects.</p>

<p><i>Cypress "C" Grade.</i>—Has small sound knots and other slight
defects such as can be covered with paint. All siding is bundled
10 pieces to the bunch in random lengths. Not furnished in
specified lengths.</p>

<p><i>Yellow Pine and Cypress Finish.</i>—This stock in "clear" grade
is practically free from defects. The yellow pine is suitable for
interior finish. Cypress is suitable for inside finish or for cornice
work on first class jobs. "C" cypress finish contains some
knots and other slight defects. Is suitable for outside finish on
ordinary jobs.</p>

<p><i>White Pine Boards.</i> As a rule, carried in stock only in No. 1
grade. Nothing but sound, red-knotted boards should be included.
No shakes. Excellent for exposure to weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">-146-</span></p>

<p><b>77. Estimating Lumber Quantities.</b>—Lumber is measured in
terms of the board foot as a unit, 12" by 12" by 1" or its equivalent,
indicated by the abbreviation B. M. (board measure).</p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Example:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;Determine the B. M. in a girder 6" by 8" by 16'.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution:</i><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;Rule—Thickness in inches times width in inches, divided by 12" times<br>
  &#160;&#160;the length in feet gives a number equal to the number of board feet.<br>
<br>
   &#160;&#160;(6" × 8") / 12 × 16' = 64' B.M.<br>
</div>

<p>Stock less than 1" thick is figured as 1" thick. In commercial
practice lumbermen make use of tables in determining quantities.
Appendix III.</p>

<p>In estimating quantities, suitable allowance must be made
for waste. This waste is incurred (1) thru loss when boards or
planks are cut to required lengths. Standard lengths are 10', 12',
14', etc., and these will not always cut to advantage. (2) Waste
is incurred in machining the stock, as dressing, edging, tonguing
and grooving. Necessary allowances will be indicated herein.</p>

<p><i>Heavy Timbers.</i> Girders, posts, etc., are determined by count.</p>

<p><i>Joists.</i> To determine the number of joists required for a room
or a building, count the actual number required beginning at a
wall (¾ times number of feet in length or width of room when set
16" on centers), and to this add one joist to be placed against the
second wall.</p>

<p>Cataloged or listed sizes are for lumber fresh from the saw.
Shrinkage due to seasoning and surfacing one side and one edge so
that the stock may have uniform thickness and width will give
actual sizes as follows: 2" × 4" when sized on one side and one edge,
will give 1⅝" x 3⅝"; 2" × 6", <i>S</i>-1-<i>S</i> and 1<i>E</i>, 1⅝" × 5⅝"; 2" × 8",
<i>S</i>-1-<i>S</i> and 1<i>E</i> gives 1⅝" × 7½"; 2" × 10", <i>S</i>-1-<i>S</i> and 1<i>E</i> gives
1⅝" x 9½"; 2" x 12", <i>S</i>-1-<i>S</i> and 1<i>E</i> gives 1⅝ x 11½. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">-147-</span>
<i>S</i>-2-<i>S</i> and 2<i>E</i> or sized on 4 sides, stock will measure ⅛" less than
indicated above.</p>

<p><i>Studs for Walls and Partitions.</i>—Count one for each lineal foot of
wall or partition, where specified 16" on centers. The extra studs
are to be used in doubling corners, at doors and windows, and in
gables. Barns and sheds will not require these extra studs.</p>

<p><i>Bridging.</i>—Allow 25 lineal feet of 2" by 4" for each square of
flooring.</p>

<p><i>Rafters.</i>—On a plain roof, count actual number and add one,
as in counting for joists.</p>

<p><i>Sheathing.</i>—Calculate the exact surface to be covered, deduct
openings; then, for unmatched sheathing or barn boards or fencing,
as it is also called, add 1/12 for 12" boards, 1/16 for 10" boards and ⅛
where 8" boards are used. Four inch and 6" are seldom laid solid,
being used mainly for roof sheathing for shingle roofs, and laid 2"
apart. These additions are due to the fact that thru seasoning and
dressing, a 12" board becomes 11½", a 10" becomes 9⅝", an 8"
becomes 7¾", a 6" becomes 5¾" and a 4" becomes 3¾". The
additions specified allow for waste in cutting.</p>

<p><i>Shiplap.</i> Calculate the exact surface to be covered, deduct
openings; then add for floors 17%, for sidewalls 20%, for
roofs 25%.</p>

<p>Sheathing laid with 2" spaces should have proportionate deductions
made, that is, on 1" × 6", figure as if laid solid, then
deduct ¼; for 1" × 4" deduct ⅓. Sheathing when matched, such
as is used sometimes for sub-floors and side walls and roof sheathing
under slate roofs and better known as flooring, will be estimated by
figuring the exact surface to be covered, deducting the openings,
then adding for 6" stock, which is the kind most always used, 15%
for floors, 17% for sidewalls, and 20% for roofs.</p>

<p>If shiplap or matched sheathing is laid diagonally add 5% for
waste due to lack of ability to reverse cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">-148-</span></p>

<p><i>Siding.</i>— For bevel siding, calculate the exact surface, deduct
openings; then add for 6" siding when laid 4½" to the weather,
33%; for the 4" siding add 50%.</p>

<p><i>Drop Siding.</i>—Drop siding, ceiling and wainscoting are
figured just like matched flooring, which is described below.</p>

<p><i>Flooring.</i>—For square edge, calculate the exact surface to be
covered, add for 6" flooring 11% for waste in matching, etc.; for
4" flooring add 20%. It is becoming common practice to specify
flooring by actual face measurement after being machined. The
following figures are for actual surface measurements.</p>

<p>For matched flooring, calculate the exact surface to be covered,
then add 20% for 5¼" flooring, for 3¼" flooring add 25%, for 2¼"
add 33%, for 1½ add 40%.</p>

<p>Flooring less than 1" thick, like all other lumber, is estimated as
1" thick.</p>

<p><i>Shingles.</i>—A bunch of shingles contains the equivalent of
250 shingles of 4" average width. With an exposure of 4½" to the
weather a 4" average shingle will cover 18 square inches, making
800 shingles to the square. Waste in doubling the first course and
in laying will necessitate an addition of 8% on a plain roof and
12% on hips or on gabled walls. Cost estimates are based upon
the M. or 1000.</p>

<p class="tdc">SHINGLES PER SQUARE</p>

   Plain roof, 5&#160;" exposure, 790; roof cut up, &#160;&#160;810
</div>

<p><i>Lath.</i> Lath for interior plaster work are usually ⅜" by 1⅜"
by 4', put up in bundles of 50 each and are sold by the 1000.
1000 lath will cover 70 yards of surface and will require 8 lbs. of
3d fine lath nails. Lathing is usually considered a part of the
plasterer's contract. There is no uniformity of practice as to the
deduction for openings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">-149-</span></p>

<p><i>Building Papers.</i> The cheapest is "rosin sized," and is not
waterproof. This is used mainly under floors and upon side walls
under bevel siding. It is sold by the pound in rolls each 36" wide
containing 500 square feet.</p>

<p>Dry felt is used where better protection from cold is desired.
In the cheaper grades, the material is made of wood fiber and rosin.
In the better grades wool is used. Tar felt, used where moisture
is to be resisted, is dry felt saturated with tar. These materials
are sold by the pound: 12, 15, and 20 lbs. to the 100 square feet,
in rolls of various widths. A catalog should be consulted for
weights and covering capacity.</p>

<p><b>78. Estimating Millwork Quantities.</b>—The number of doors
and windows will be determined by an actual count.</p>

<p>Mouldings, casings, baseboard when moulded, window stools,
etc., are sold by the 100 feet lineal measure, random lengths.
Extra charge is made for specified lengths where the quantities are
determined by scale measurements of the plan and elevations.
Window frames of stock sizes, door frames, inside jambs, stair
parts, buffets, etc., will be found priced in millmen's catalogs, and
assist greatly in determining prices for ordinary work. This text
cannot give space to list such data, which is so readily obtained
from commercial catalogs.</p>

<p><b>80. Estimating Labor Costs.</b><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>—In estimating labor costs the
following data is to be made use of. The estimator will have
to determine the hours per day and the scale of wages per hour
paid in his locality, and make whatever changes in the data is
necessary. He should also compare the quantity of work done by
men he may observe with that given herewith. The time data
herewith is based upon the work of one mechanic who has mastered
his trade fairly well. With an efficient foreman and a selected
group of workmen these time allowances can be reduced in many
instances as much as one-half. Experience alone will determine
the possibilities of such reductions with safety.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> For a more complete treatise of labor costs, the student is referred to
Gillette's Handbook of Cost Data, Section X, the source, in the main, of the
basis of this data.</p>

<p><b>82. Example of Form for Carpentry Costs.</b>—The following
form, used by a practical carpenter, and published in the Correspondence
Department of <i>The American Carpenter and Builder</i>,
should suggest means whereby the data just given may be made
more readily available for estimating purposes.</p>

<p>It must be remembered in interpreting all such data that costs
will vary greatly with conditions. A carpenter, for illustration,
who gives his time and attention to general carpentry cannot lay
shingles with the speed a specialist in shingling can. Again, a
carpenter cannot make window and door frames by hand with the
same speed that these can be made by machinery in a mill. The
prices given herewith are for work done by a general carpentry
mechanic. The estimator should test out these figures to see
how they compare with actual working conditions in his community.
The following table is made for "country" conditions,
the men working at 30c per hour, 9 hours a day.</p>

<p><b>83. Total Building Costs by Percentages.</b>—Having carefully
estimated the costs of one or two of the large items in a building,
such as lumber or millwork or labor, the total cost of a building
may be approximated with a fair degree of accuracy by a general
contractor by means of the following table of percentages. Foundations
or any other parts of a building which may be unusual
should be excluded and figured separately in detail. In any event,
before a building is finally completed the contractor will have to
settle with each sub-contractor upon the basis of detailed cost
estimates. Where time is available, the contractor as a rule
secures bids from the various sub-contractors, such as the plumber,
the lather, the mason, etc., combining these and adding his commission
of 10% for oversight, and an additional 10% for incidentals
or contingencies.</p>

<p>These ratios are known as natural functions of the angle because
their values change with every change in the value of the angle.</p>

<p>The lengthening of the sides of the angle should not be mistaken
for a change in the value of the angle. Draw to scale very
carefully any angle and drop lines from any two points, as at <i>B</i>
and <i>B′</i>, <a href="#fig_152">Fig. 152</a>, which shall be perpendicular to the base line.
Measure the sides of the triangles so formed and express their
ratios as functions of the angle <i>A</i>. Comparing like functions of
large and small triangle it will be seen that once an angle is known
in degrees, its sine, cosine, etc., are determined irrespective of the
length of sides. And, vice versa, if we know the functional values
or ratios of certain sides of the right triangle formed about an
angle, we have determined the value of the angle in degrees. The
Table of Natural Trigonometric Functions, Appendix II, is nothing
more than a compilation of these various ratios carefully figured
out and placed in the form of a table to assist in the easy solution
of problems having to do with the finding of certain parts of a
triangle when other parts are given.</p>

<p>With a protractor, measure the angle A of the triangle whose
sides were just measured, and compare the ratios of the sides or the
functional values with those given in the Table, Appendix III, for
the same angle. The larger the scale of the drawing, the greater
the accuracy. By making use of the hundredths scale of the
framing square together with a finely pointed pair of dividers,
variation in values should not be great.</p>

<p><b>Solutions of Right Triangles.</b>—By the solution of right triangles
is meant the finding of unknown sides or angles when values
of other sides and angles are known.</p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Example 1.</i>—Given <i>A</i> = 30 degrees, <i>c</i> = 24; Find <i>B, a, b</i>.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution</i>—<i>B</i> = 90-30 = 60 degrees. (The sum of the angles of a triangle<br>
  &#160;&#160;equals 180 degrees. <i>C</i> = 90 degrees.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">-160-</span><br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(1) <i>a</i>/<i>c</i> = sin <i>A</i>; whence, <i>a</i> = <i>c</i> sin <i>A</i>.<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(<i>a</i> = <i>c</i> times sine <i>A</i>.)<br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(2) <i>b</i>/<i>c</i> = cos <i>A</i>; whence <i>b</i> = <i>c</i> cos <i>A</i>.<br>
</div>

<p>From the Tables, Appendix II, sin of <i>A</i>, or 30 degrees, = .5.
Substituting numerical values in (1), <i>a</i> = 12.</p>

<p>Again, from Tables, cos <i>A</i>, or 30 degrees, = .866. Substituting
numerical values in (2), <i>b</i> = 20.784.</p>

<p>Arith. check <i>c²</i> = <i>a²</i> + <i>b²</i>; 24² = 12² + 20.78²; 576 = 144 + 431.8;
576 = 576.</p>

<p>Graphic check.-—The graphic check which, it will be seen,
might have been made use of as a graphic solution, consists in
setting one square upon another with the angle of direction
and the length of one side determined by the data given. That
is, in this problem the protractor is set at 30 degrees and a
length of 24 units is taken on the inclined square. The lengths
of a and b are then carefully measured by taking a reading of
the full inches and reading, the remaining fraction to hundredths
by means of a sharp pair of dividers and the hundredths scale of
the square.</p>

<p>Very many carpenters make use of graphic solutions such as
this in determining rafter lengths. A little consideration, however,
will show that it is a rather risky method of procedure unless the
scale is large and the work scaled small. Graphs serve as easy
checks against grave errors upon all kinds of work.</p>

<p>Directions. An examination of the table of natural functions
will indicate in the column at the left, angles of degrees to and
including 45 degrees, reading down. The column to the extreme
right will be found to contain degrees from 45-90 inclusive, reading
up.</p>

<p>This compact arrangement of table is made possible thru the
fact that sines and cosines, tangents and cotangents are reciprocals
one of the other. That is, as the sine (column 2, reading down)
increases in value, the cosine of the complementary angle (columns
6 and 2, reading up) decreases.</p>

<div class="exsol">
  <i>Example 1.</i>—Find the value of the sine of 40 degrees.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution</i>—Columns 1 and 2, reading down, sin 40 degrees = .6428.<br>
<br>
  <i>Example 2.</i>—Find the value of sin 50 degrees.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution</i>—Columns 6 and 5, reading up, sin 50 degrees = .7660.<br>
<br>
  <i>Example 3.</i>—Find the value of cos 40 degrees.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution</i>—Columns 1 and 5, reading down, cos 40 degrees = .7660<br>
  &#160;&#160;which is as might have been expected. Since 40 degrees is the<br>
  &#160;&#160;complement of 50 degrees, the cos 40 degrees should be the same in<br>
  &#160;&#160;value as the sin 50 degrees.<br>
<br>
  <i>Example 4.</i>—Find the value of cos 87 degrees.<br>
<br>
  <i>Solution</i>—Columns 6 and 2 reading up, cos 87 degrees = .0523<br>
<br>
  <i>Example 5.</i>—Tangent and cotangent values. Proceed as with sines<br>
  &#160;&#160;using columns 1 and 3, reading down, for tangent values between 0-45<br>
  &#160;&#160;degrees inclusive, columns 6 and 4, reading up, for values between<br>
  &#160;&#160;45-90 degrees.<br>
<br>
  &#160;&#160;For cotangent values between 0-45 degrees use columns 1 and 4 reading<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;down, and columns 6 and 3 reading up for cotangent values between<br>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;45-90 degrees inclusive.<br>

<p>The value of a fractional degree would be similarly treated for
the sine, these functions increasing as the value of the angle increases.
The cosine and cotangent, however, decrease in value as
the angle increases. For this reason the fractional value of the
cosine and cotangent must be subtracted from, instead of added to,
the value of the function of the next lower number of degrees.</p>

<p>Rule: (1) Search the body of the table for the functional values
next above and next below that given. (2) Find the difference
between these functional values. This difference is for an interval
of 1 degree or 60 minutes. (3) Find the difference between the
given functional value and that of the lower angle of the two used
above. (4) Express this last difference as the numerator of a
fraction whose denominator is the first difference found, or the
difference for the interval of 1 degree. This gives the fractional
part of 1 degree or 60 minutes which the second difference is.
(5) Express this difference in minutes and add if the function be a
sine or tangent, and substract if a cosine or cotangent to the
number of degrees representing the angle whose function was the
lower of the two functions found given in the table.</p>

<p>Where rafter lengths are determined by multiplying unit
lengths by the run, the answer will almost invariably result in
a decimal. Such decimal values may be readily translated into
fractional forms by means of the accompanying table.</p>

<div class="exsol">
  Example: A roof of ⅓ pitch has a common rafter run of 14';
  find the length of common rafter.

  Answer: 14 × 14.42" = 201.88" or 16.82'. By the table, .82 = 53/64.
  A carpenter, however, would not care for such accuracy; the
  nearest 1/16" or even ⅛" would be sufficient.

<p>Frequently the carpenter wishes to know the diameter of hole
necessary to receive the shank of a screw of a certain gage. Should
a screw gage be accessible, he may readily determine this. Should
no gage be at hand, he may determine the size of hole by consulting
the accompanying table of Wood and Machine Screw Sizes.</p>

<p>Example: What size bit must be selected to bore a hole for a
No. 10 screw. By the table, a No. 10 screw is .18944" in diameter.
By the table of Fractional Equivalents for Decimal Values it will
be seen that a 3/16" bit must be used. The test for gage of screw is
always made over the shank just below the head.</p>

<p>Nails are sold in quantity by the keg, 100 lbs. of nails, exclusive
of the keg. Twenty, 30, 40, 50 and 60d are "base." Other
sizes have certain fixed additions per keg to this base price. For example,
the price list adopted by manufacturers in 1896 allows an
addition per keg of $.70 for 2d common, $.45 for 3d common, etc.</p>

<p>Wire nails are also bought and sold by weight, the size of wire
according to the standard wire gage and the length in inches being
taken into consideration in specifying the size and in fixing the
price per pound.</p>

<p>Common wire nails are thick and have large flat heads. They
are used in rough work where strength is desired. Finishing nails
are used for fine work such as inside woodwork and cabinet work.
Casing nails are somewhat thicker and stronger than finishing
nails; they have smaller heads.</p>

Roof</span></p>

<p><b>Directions for Using Table for the Steel Square.</b>—Fig. 70-a.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span>—Given a square hipped roof, that is, a roof with
square corners, having a span of 25 ft. and a pitch of ½.</p>

<p>1. <i>To Lay Out Miter Cut of Plate.</i>—Take 12" on tongue of
framing square and 12" on blade; scribe along blade. (Cf. small
table, <a href="#fig_70-a">Fig. 70-a</a>.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Length of Ridge.</i>—Length of long plate diminished by length
of short plate, increased by thickness of ridge piece plus diagonal
thickness of hip.</p>

<p>3. <i>To Lay Out Common Rafter.</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a. Plumb cut. (Cf. column 5, beginning at left, <a href="#fig_70-a">Fig. 70-a</a>.) Take
12" on tongue of square and 12" on blade (column 2), scribe
along blade.</p>

<p>b. Length of common rafter. (Cf. column 11) 12½ (run of common
rafter) x 16.97" (length of common rafter per foot of run) =
17' 8.12" = 17' 8⅛ (.12" = ⅛", columns 3 and 4).</p>

<p>c. Seat cut. (Cf. column 8) Take 12" on tongue and 12" on blade;
scribe along tongue.</p>

<p>d. Tail for common rafter.</p>

<p>(1) Length determined as was that of common rafter, the horizontal
projection or length of look- out becoming multiplier. 173</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">-174-</span></p>

<p>(2) End cut use same numbers as for plumb cut but
invert position of square.</p>

<p>e. Reduction for ridge. Measure straight back from plumb cut a
distance equal to 3/ the thickness of ridge piece.</p>
</div>

<p>4. <i>To Lay Out Hip or Valley Rafter.-</i>-</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a. Plumb cut. (Cf. column 6) Take 17" on the tongue and 12" on
the blade; scribe along the blade.</p>

<p>b. Side cut. (Cf. column 16) Take 17" on the tongue and 20.78" or
20-13/16" (columns 3 and 4) on the blade; scribe along the blade.</p>

<p>This also gives the miter cut at the end of the tail of the hip for
fascia, and also the miter cut at the bird's mouth joint of
valley rafter, where it must be cut out to fit the angle of
the plate.</p>

<p>c. Length of hip or valley rafter. (Cf. column 12) 12½ (run of
common rafter) x 20.78" (length of hip or valley rafter per
foot of run of common rafter) = 21' 7.75" = 21' 7¾" (.75 = ¾,
columns 3 and 4.)</p>

<p>d. Seat cut. (Cf. column 9) Take 17" on tongue and 12" on the
blade, scribe along the tongue.</p>

<p>e. Tail for hip or valley rafter.</p>

<p>(1) Length determined as was that of hip or valley rafter, the
horizontal projection of tail or length of the lookout of
common rafter becoming the multiplier.</p>

<p>(2) End cut use same numbers as for plumb cut of hip or valley but
invert square.</p>

<p>f. Reduction for ridge. Measure straight back from plumb cut ½
diagonal thickness of ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">-175-</span></p>

<p>g. Backing of hip. (Cf. column 21) Take 12" (rise of common
rafter) on the tongue and 20-13/16" on the blade scribe along
the tongue for angle of backing.</p>

<p>h. Drop of hip when no backing is given. (Cf. column 23) Reduce
at seat cut 9/16", measured at right angles to seat cut.</p>
</div>

<p>5. <i>To Lay Out Jacks.</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a. Plumb cut. Same as that for the common rafter!</p>

<p>b. Side cut. (Cf. column 14) Take 12" on the tongue and 16.97" or
17" on blade (.97" = 1", columns 3 and 4), scribe on the blade.</p>

<p>Scribing along the tongue will give the face cut of roof boards,
also of plancher.</p>

<p>c. Length. Jacks set 24" centers, beginning with shortest jack
=2' 10" (column 19). Second shortest jack = length of shortest
increased 2' 10", etc.</p>

<p>Beginning with longest jack = length of common rafter diminished
by 2' 10", etc.</p>

<p>d. Tail for jack. Same as for common rafter.</p>
</div>

<p>6. <i>Note.</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All rafter lengths are measured down the middle of the top edges
theoretically. On the square cornered roof, measurements of hip
or valley rafters may be made from the long point without further
reduction in length providing a 2" thick ridge is used. Jacks
need no further reduction in length on a square cornered building

The price will vary somewhat according to the mixture and the
amount of form work required. Mixtures are designated as
"rich"—1 part cement, 2 parts sand, 4 parts crushed rock, by
volume; "medium"—1:2½:5; "ordinary"—1:3:6, and "lean,"—1:4:8.
The rich mixture is used for cellar floors on high grade
work. Cisterns and tanks make use of a special mixture of 1:2:3,
the stone or gravel being passed thru a %" screen. Cement topping
for cellar floors is a mortar composed of 1 part cement and 2
parts sharp sand. Sometimes a 1:1 mixture is used. Cellar
floors and sidewalks are often priced by the foot surface measure,

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
